			<h2>'A Midsummer Night's Dream' by William Shakespeare<br />Act III Sc II Puck</h2>
			<p>Puck: My mistress with a monster is in love. Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
			A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play, Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day.
			The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented in their sport, Forsook his scene and entered in a brake. When I did him at this advantage take,
			An ass's nole I fixed on his head. Anon his Thisby must be answered, And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy, As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
			Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, Rising and cawing at the gun's report, Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky;
			So at his sight away his fellows fly, And at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls; He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
			Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong, For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch:
			Some, sleeves -- some, hats; from yielders all things catch. I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there,
			When in that moment (so it came to pass) Titania waked, and straightway loved an ass.</p>

			<h2>'A Midsummer Night's Dream' by William Shakespeare Helena Act III Sc II</h2>
			<p>Helena: How happy some o'er other some can be!

Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.

But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;

He will not know what all but he do know.

And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,

So I, admiring of his qualities.

Things base and vile, holding no quantity,

Love can transpose to form and dignity.

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,

And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste;

Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.

And therefore is Love said to be a child,

Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,

So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.

For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne,

He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;

And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,

So he dissolved, and show'rs of oaths did melt.

I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight.

Then to the wood will he to-morrow night

Pursue her; and for this intelligence

If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.

But herein mean I to enrich my pain,

To have his sight thither and back again.</p>

			<h2>'Antigone' by Sophocles</h2>
			<p>Antigone: Tomb, bridal chamber, eternal prison in the caverned rock, whither I go to find mine own, those many who have perished, and whom Persephone hath received among the dead! Last of all shall I pass thither, and far most miserably of all, before the term of my life is spent. But I cherish good hope that my coming will be welcome to my father, and pleasant to thee, my mother, and welcome, brother, to thee; for, when you died, with mine own hands I washed and dressed you, and poured drink-offerings at your graves; and now, Plyneices, 'tis for tending thy corpse that I win such recompense as this. And yet I honoured thee, as the wise will deem, rightly. Never had I been a mother of children, or if a husband had been mouldering in death, would I have taken this task upon me in the city's despite. What law, ye ask, is my warrant for that word? The husband lost, another might have been found, and child from another, to replace the first-born; but, father and mother hidden with Hades, no brother's life could ever bloom for me again. Such was the law whereby I held thee first in honour; but Creon deemed me guilty of error therein, and of outrage, ah brother mine! And now he leads me thus, a captive in his hands; no bridal bed, no bridal song hath been mine, no joy of marriage, no portion in the nurture of children; but thus, forlorn of friends, unhappy one, I go living to the vaults of death. And what law of Heaven have I transgressed? Why, hapless one, should I look to the gods any more--what ally should I invoke--when by piety I have earned the name of impious? Nay, then, if these things are pleasing to the gods, when I have suffered my doom, I shall come to know my sin; but if the sin is with my judges, I could wish them no fuller measue of evil than they, on their part, mete wrongfully to me.</p>

			<h2>'Antigone' by Sophocles Creon</h2>
			<p>Creon: Sirs, the vessel of our state, after being tossed on wild waves, hath once more been safely steadied by the gods: and ye, out of all the folk, have been called apart by my summons, because I knew, first of all, how true and constant was your reverence for the royal power of Laius; how, again, when Oedipus was ruler of our land, and when he had perished, your steadfast loyalty still upheld their children. Since, then, his sons have fallen in one day by a twofold doom--each smitten by the other, each stained with a brother's blood--I now possess the throne and all its powers, by nearness of kinship to the dead. No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he hath been seen versed in rule and law-giving. For if any, being supreme guide of the state, cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through some fear, keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him most base; and if any makes a friend of more account than his fatherland, that man hath no place in my regard. For I--be Zeus my witness, who sees all things always--would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, coming to the citizens; nor would I ever deem the country's foe a friend to myself; remembering this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that only while she prospers in our voyage can we make true friends. Such are the rules by which I guard this city's greatness. And in accord with them is the edict which I have now published to the folk touching the sons of Oedipus; that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting for our city, in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned with every rite that follows the noblest dead to their rest. But for his brother, Polyneices--who came back from exile, and sought to consume utterly with fire the city of his fathers and the shrines of his fathers' gods--sought to taste of kindred blood, and to lead the remnant into slavery--touching this man, it hath been proclaimed to our people that none shall grace him with sepulture or lament, but leave him unburied, a corpse for birds and dogs to eat, a ghastly sight of shame.</p>

			<h2>'Doctor Faustus' by Christopher Marlowe Sc VIII Faustus</h2>
			<p>Faustus: Ah, Faustus. Now hast thou but one bare hour to live, And then thou must be damn'd perpetually! Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven, That time may cease, and midnight never come; Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make Perpetual day; or let this hour be but A year, a month, a week, a natural day, That Faustus may repent and save his soul! O lente, lente currite, noctis equi! The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike, The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd. O, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?-- See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament! One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ!-- Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ! Yet will I call on him: O, spare me, Lucifer!-- Where is it now? tis gone: and see, where God Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows! Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me, And hide me from the heavy wrath of God! No, no! Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth, gape! O, no, it will not harbour me! You stars that reign'd at my nativity, Whose influence hath alotted death and hell, Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist, Into the entrails of yon labouring clouds, That, when you vomit forth into the air, My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths, So that my soul may but ascend to heaven! [The clock strikes the half-hour.] Ah, half the hour is past! 'twill all be past anon. O God, If thou wilt not have mercy on my soul, Yet for Christ's sake, whose blood hath ransom'd me, Impose some end to my incessant pain; Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years, A hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd! O, no end is limited to damned souls! Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul? Or why is this immortal that thou hast? Ah, Pythagoras' metempsychosis, were that true, This soul should fly from me, and I be chang'd Unto some brutish beast! all beasts are happy, For, when they die, Their souls are soon dissolv'd in elements; But mine must live still to be plagu'd in hell. Curs'd be the parents that engender'd me! No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer That hath depriv'd thee of the joys of heaven. [The clock strikes twelve.] O, it strikes, it strikes! Now, body, turn to air, Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell! [Thunder and lightning.] O soul, be chang'd into little water-drops, And fall into the ocean, ne'er be found! [Enter Devils.] My God, my God, look not so fierce on me! Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!  Ugly hell, gape not! come not, Lucifer!I'll burn my books!</p>

			<h2>'Easter' by August Strindberg</h2>
			<p>Eleanora: He may come, and we can go--from everything! -- from all the old furniture which father has been accumulating for us, and which I have seen ever since I was a little child. One should not own anything that binds one to earth. Go out on the stony highways and wander with bleeding feet, for that way leads upwards, therefore it is difficult-- [Pause] Do you know what I find hardest to part with? It is the old clock over there. That was here when I was born, and it has measured my hours and my days. Hear how it beats, exactly like a heart. It stopped on the hour that grandfather died -- for it was here even then. Farewell, little clock, may you soon stop again! Do you know that it used to hasten when we had ill-luck in the house -- as though it wanted to get past the evil, for our sakes, of course. But when the times were bright, it slowed down, that we might enjoy them all the longer. It was the good clock. But we had a bad one too. It has to hang in the kitchen now. The bad clock couldn't tolerate music, and as soon as Elis touched the piano, it began striking. Not I alone, but all noticed it; and that is why it has to stand in the kitchen. Lina does not like it, either, for it isn't quiet at night, and she can't boil eggs by it because they always become hard-boiled, she says. Now you are laughing!</p>

			<h2>'Electra' by Euripides</h2>
			<p>Electra: Let me then speak; but where shall I begin. Thy insults to recount? With what conclude? Or how pursue the train of my discourse? I never with the opening morn forbore To breathe my silent plaints, which to thy face I wished to utter, from my former fears If e'er I should be free: I now am free. Now, to thee living what I wished to speak, I will recount. Thou hast destroyed my hopes, Made me an orphan, him and me bereft Of a dear father, by no wrongs enforced. My mother basely wedding, thou hast slain The glorious leader of the Grecian arms, Yet never didst thou tread the fields of Troy. Nay, such thy folly, thou couldst hope to find My mother, shouldst thou wed her, nought of ill To thee intending: hence my father's bed By thee was foully wronged. But let him know Who with forbidden love another's wife Corrupts, then by necessity constrained Receives her as his own, should he expect To find that chastity preserved to him, Which to her former bed was not preserved, He must be wretched from his frustrate hope. And what a life of misery didst thou lead, Though not by thee deemed ill? Thy conscious mind Of thy unholy nuptials felt the guilt: My mother knew that she an impious man In thee had wedded; and, polluted both, Thou hadst her fortune, she thy wickedness. 'Mongst all the Argives, this had fame divulged, The man obeys the wife, and not the wife Her husband: shameful this, when in the house The woman sovereign rules, and not the man. And when of children speaks the public voice As from the mother, not the father sprung, To me it is unpleasing. He who weds A wife of higher rank and nobler blood, Sinks into nothing, in her splendour lost. Thus truth unknown, thy pride was most deceived, Thyself as great thou vauntedst, in the power Of riches vainly elevate; but these Are nothing, their enjoyment frail and brief; Nature is firm, not riches; she remains For ever, and triumphant lifts her head. But unjust wealth, which sojourns with the base, Glitters for some short space, then flies away. To women thy demeanour I shall pass Unmentioned, for to speak it ill beseems A virgin's tongue; yet I shall make it known By indistinct suggestion. Arrogance Swelled thy vain mind, for that the royal house Was thine, and beauty graced thy perfect form. But be not mine a husband whose fair face In softness with a virgin's vies, but one Of manly manners; for the sons of such By martial toils are trained to glorious deeds: The beauteous only to the dance give grace. Perish, thou wretch, to nothing noble formed; Such was thou found, and vengeance on thy head At length hath burst; so perish all, that dare Atrocious deeds! Nor deem, though fair his course At first, that he hath vanquished Justice ere He shall have reached the goal, the end of life.</p>

			<h2>'Frankenstein' by Mary Shelley</h2>
			<p>Elizabeth: I am the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by, and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may, therefore, be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion. But when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care. And afterward attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead, and acted toward him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action. As to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.</p>

			<h2>'Getting Married' by George Bernard Shaw</h2>
			<p>Collins: No, maam; marriage didn't come natural. My wife had to break me into it. It came natural to her: she's what you might call a regular old hen. Always wants to have her family within sight of her. Wouldn't go to bed unless she knew they was all safe at home and the door locked, and the lights out. Always wants her luggage in the carriage with her. Always goes and makes the engine driver promise her to be careful. She's a born wife and mother, maam. That's why my children all ran away from home. I very often felt inclined to run away myself, but when it came to the point I couldn't bear to hurt her feelings. She's a sensitive, affectionate, anxious soul; and she was never brought up to know what freedom is to some people. You see, family life is all the life she knows: she's like a bird born in a cage, that would die if you let it loose in the woods. When I thought how little it was to a man of my easy temper to put up with her, and how deep it would hurt her to think it was because I didn't care for her, I always put off running away till next time; and so in the end I never ran away at all. I daresay it was good for me to be took such care of; but it cut me off from all my old friends something dreadful, maam: especially the women, maam. She never gave them a chance; she didn't indeed. She never understood that married people should take holidays from one another if they are to keep at all fresh. Not that I ever got tired of her, maam; but my! how I used to get tired of home life sometimes. I used to catch myself envying my brother George: I positively did, maam. He married a very fine figure of a woman; but she was that changeable and what you might call susceptible, you would not believe. She didn't seem to have any control over herself when she fell in love. She would mope for a couple of days, crying about nothing; and then she would up and say--no matter who was there to hear her--"I must go to him, George!"; and away she would go from her home and her husband without with-your-leave or by-your-leave. She done it five times to my own knowledge; and then George gave up telling us about it, he got so used to it. Well, what could he do, maam? Three times out of four the men would bring her back the same evening and no harm done. Other times they'd run away from her. What could any man with a heart do but comfort her when she came back crying at the way they dodged her when she threw herself at their heads, pretending they was too noble to accept the sacrifice she was making. George told her again and again that if she'd only stay at home and hold off a bit they'd be at her feet all day long. She got sensible at last and took his advice. George always liked change of company. You may think her odious--many ladies with a domestic turn thought so and said so, maam. But I will say for Mrs. George that the variety of experience made her wonderful interesting. That's where the flighty ones score off the steady ones, maam. Look at my old woman! She's never known any man but me; and she can't properly know me, because she don't know other men to compare me with. Of course she knows her parents in--well, in the way one does know one's parents: not knowing half their lives as you might say, or ever thinking that they was ever young; and she knew her children as children, and never thought of them as independent human beings till they ran away and nigh broke her heart for a week or two. But Mrs. George, she came to know a lot about men of all sorts and ages; for the older she got the younger she liked em; and it certainly made her interesting, and gave her a lot of sense. I have often taken her advice on things when my own poor old woman wouldn't have been a bit of use to me. All you have to do is mesmerize her a bit; and off she goes into a trance, and says the most wonderful things! not things about herself, but as if it was the whole human race giving you a bit of its mind. Oh, wonderful, maam, I assure you. You couldn't think of a game that Mrs. George isn't up to!</p>

			<h2>'Hamlet' by William Shakespeare Act I Sc V Ghost of Hamlet's Father</h2>
			<p>Ghost: I am thy father's spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love, Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown. Thy uncle, Ay, that incestuous, that adulterous beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traiterous gifts-- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce! -- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel linked, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft, methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigor it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine, And a most instant tetter barked about Most lazar-like with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I sleeping by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled, No reck'ning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But howsomever thou pursues this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.  The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.</p>

			<h2>'Hamlet' by William Shakespeare Act III Sc I Hamlet</h2>
			<p>Hamlet: To be, or not to be--that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-- No more--and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprise of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now, The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.</p>

With what a majesty he bears himself, How insolent of late he is become, How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself? We know the time since he was mild and affable, And if we did but glance a far-off look, Immediately he was upon his knee, That all the court admired him for submission; But meet him now and, be it in the morn, When every one will give the time of day, He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee, Disdaining duty that to us belongs. Small curs are not regarded when they grin, But great men tremble when the lion roars, And Humphrey is no little man in England. First note that he is near you in descent, And should you fall, he is the next will mount. Me seemeth then it is no policy, Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease, That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your highness' council. By flattery hath he won the commons' heart; And when he please to make commotion, 'Tis to be feared they all will follow him. Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted. Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the duke. If it be fond, call it a woman's fear; Which fear if better reasons can supplant, I will subscribe and say I wronged the duke. My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York, Reprove my allegation if you can, Or else conclude my words effectual.</p>

Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would," Like the poor cat i' the adage? What beast was't then That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both. They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done this. If we should fail? Screw your courage to the sticking place And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep (Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lies as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon Th' unguarded Duncan? what not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?</p>

			<h2>'Medea' by Euripides</h2>
			<p>Jason: I ought not to be rash, it seems, in speech,

But like the skilful pilot, who, with sails

Scarce half unfurled, his bark more surely guides,

Escape, O woman, your ungoverned tongue.

Since you the benefits on me conferred

Exaggerate in so proud a strain, I deem

That I to Venus only, and no god

Or man beside, my prosperous voyage owe.

Although a wondrous subtlety of soul

To you belong, 'twere an invidious speech

For me to make should I relate how Love

By his inevitable shafts constrained you

To save my life. I will not therefore state

This argument too nicely, but allow,

As you did aid me, it was kindly done.

But by preserving me have you gained more

Than you bestowed, as I shall prove: and first,

Transplanted from barbaric shores, you dwell

In Grecian regions, and have here been taught

To act as justice and the laws ordain,

Nor follow the caprice of brutal strength.

By all the Greeks your wisdom is perceived,

And you acquire renown; but had you still

Inhabited that distant spot of earth,

You never had been named. I would not wish

For mansions heaped with gold, or to exceed

The sweetest notes of Orpheus' magic lyre,

Were those unfading wreaths which fame bestows

From me withheld by fortune. I thus far

On my own labours only have discoursed.

For you this odious strife of words began.

But in espousing Creon's royal daughter,

With which you have reproached me, I will prove

That I in acting thus am wise and chaste,

That I to you have been the best of friends,

And to our children. But make no reply.

Since hither Iolchos' land I came,

Accompanied by many woes, and such

As could not be avoided, what device

More advantageous would an exile frame

Than wedding the king's daughter? Not through hate

To you, which you reproach me with, not smitten

With love for a new consort, or a wish

The number of my children to augment:

For those we have already might suffice,

And I complain not. But to me it seemed

Of great importance that we both might live

As suits our rank, nor suffer abject need,

Well knowing that each friend avoids the poor.

I also wished to educate our sons

In such a manner as befits my race

And with their noble brothers yet unborn,

Make them one family, that thus, my house

Cementing, I might prosper. In some measure

Is it your interest too that by my bride

I should have sons, and me it much imports,

By future children, to provide for those

Who are in being. Have I judged amiss?

You would not censure me, unless your soul

Were by a rival stung. But your whole sex

Hath these ideas; if in marriage blest

Ye deem nought wanting, but if some reverse

Of fortune e'er betide the nuptial couch,

All that was good and lovely ye abhor.

Far better were it for the human race

Had children been produced by other means,

No females e'er existing: hence might man

Exempt from every evil have remained.</p>

			<h2>'Medea' by Euripides</h2>
			<p>Medea: O my sons!

My sons! ye have a city and a house

Where, leaving hapless me behind, without

A mother ye for ever shall reside.

But I to other realms an exile go,

Ere any help from you I could derive,

Or see you blest; the hymeneal pomp,

The bride, the genial couch, for you adorn,

And in these hands the kindled torch sustain.

How wretched am I through my own perverseness!

You, O my sons, I then in vain have nurtured,

In vain have toiled, and, wasted with fatigue,

Suffered the pregnant matron's grievous throes.

On you, in my afflictions, many hopes

I founded erst: that ye with pious care

Would foster my old age, and on the bier

Extend me after death--much envied lot

Of mortals; but these pleasing anxious thoughts

Are vanished now; for, losing you, a life

Of bitterness and anguish shall I lead.

But as for you, my sons, with those dear eyes

Fated no more your mother to behold,

Hence are ye hastening to a world unknown.

Why do ye gaze on me with such a look

Of tenderness, or wherefore smile? for these

Are your last smiles. Ah wretched, wretched me!

What shall I do? My resolution fails.

Sparkling with joy now I their looks have seen,

My friends, I can no more. To those past schemes

I bid adieu, and with me from this land

My children will convey. Why should I cause

A twofold portion of distress to fall

On my own head, that I may grieve the sire

By punishing his sons? This shall not be:

Such counsels I dismiss. But in my purpose

What means this change? Can I prefer derision,

And with impunity permit the foe

To 'scape? My utmost courage I must rouse:

For the suggestion of these tender thoughts

Proceeds from an enervate heart. My sons,

Enter the regal mansion. [Exuent SONS.] As for those

Who deem that to be present were unholy

While I the destined victims offer up,

Let them see to it. This uplifted arm

Shall never shrink. Alas! alas! my soul

Commit not such a deed. Unhappy woman,

Desist and spare thy children; we will live

Together, they in foreign realms shall cheer

Thy exile. No, by those avenging fiends

Who dwell with Pluto in the realms beneath,

This shall not be, nor will I ever leave

My sons to be insulted by their foes.

They certainly must die; since then they must,

I bore and I will slay them: 'tis a deed

Resolved on, nor my purpose will I change.

Full well I know that now the royal bride

Wears on her head the magic diadem,

And in the variegated robe expires:

But, hurried on by fate, I tread a path

Of utter wretchedness, and them will plunge

Into one yet more wretched. To my sons

Fain would I say: "O stretch forth your right hands

Ye children, for your mother to embrace.

O dearest hands, ye lips to me most dear,

Engaging features and ingenuous looks,

May ye be blest, but in another world;

For by the treacherous conduct of your sire

Are ye bereft of all this earth bestowed.

Farewell, sweet kisses--tender limbs, farewell!

And fragrant breath! I never more can bear

To look on you, my children." My afflictions

Have conquered me; I now am well aware

What crimes I venture on: but rage, the cause

Of woes most grievous to the human race,

Over my better reason hath prevailed.</p>

Act IIII Sc I Portia</h2>
			<p>Portia:The quality of mercy is not strain'd, 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; 
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: 
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown; 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; 
But mercy is above this sceptred sway; 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 
It is an attribute to God himself; 
And earthly power doth then show likest God's 
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, 
Though justice be thy plea, consider this, 
That, in the course of justice, none of us 
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render 
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much 
To mitigate the justice of thy plea; 
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice 
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</p>

			<h2>'Moby Dick' by Herman Melville</h2>
			<p>Stubb: Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man's ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the row? It's not a real leg, only a false leg.' And there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member--that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone cane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick. Besides,' thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, THERE'S a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.' But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. 'What are you 'bout?' says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. 'What am I about?' says I at last. 'And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do YOU want a kick?' By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!' 'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I--'right HERE it was.' 'Very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an honour; I consider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; BE kicked by him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can't help yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?' With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?</p>

Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.

Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)

Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;

She was too good for me. But, as I said,

On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;

That shall she, marry; I remember it well.

'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;

And she was weaned (I never shall forget it),

Of all the days of the year, upon that day;

For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.

My lord and you were then at Mantua.

Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,

When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,

To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!

Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,

To bid me trudge.

And since that time it is eleven years,

For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,

She could have run and waddled all about;

For even the day before, she broke her brow;

And then my husband (God be with his soul!

'A was a merry man) took up the child.

'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?

Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;

Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,

The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'

To see now how a jest shall come about!

I warrant, an I should live a thousand years

I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,

			<h2>'The Beaux Stratagem' by George Farquhar

Act III Sc I Mrs Sullen</h2>
			<p>Mrs. Sullen: Country pleasures! racks and torments!

Dost think, child, that my limbs were made for leaping of ditches, and clambering over stiles?

Or that my parents, wisely foreseeing my future happiness in country pleasures, had early instructed me in rural accomplishments

Of drinking fat ale, playing at whisk, and smoking tobacco with my husband?

Or of spreading of plasters, brewing of diet-drinks, and stilling rosemary-water,

With the good old gentlewoman my mother-in-law? 

Because they wanted money, child, to find out the pleasures of the town.

Did you ever see a poet or philosopher worth ten thousand pounds?

If you can show me such a man, I'll lay you fifty pounds you'll find him somewhere within the weekly bills.

Not that I disapprove rural pleasures, as the poets have painted them;

In their landscape, every Phillis has her Corydon, every murmuring stream, and every flowery mead, gives fresh alarms to love.

Besides, you'll find, that their couples were never married: -

But yonder I see my Corydon, and a sweet swain it is, Heaven knows!

Come, Dorinda, don't be angry, he's my husband, and your brother; and, between both, is he not a sad brute? 

O sister, sister! if ever you marry, beware of a sullen, silent sot, one that's always musing, but never thinks.

There's some diversion in a talking blockhead;

And since a woman must wear chains, I would have the pleasure of hearing 'em rattle a little.

Now you shall see, but take this by the way.

He came home this morning at his usual hour of four, wakened me out of a sweet dream of something else,

By tumbling over the tea-table, which he broke all to pieces;

After his man and he had rolled about the room, like sick passengers in a storm,

He comes flounce into bed, dead as a salmon into a fishmonger's basket;

His feet cold as ice, his breath hot as a furnace, and his hands and his face as greasy as his flannel night-cap.

O matrimony! He tosses up the clothes with a barbarous swing over his shoulders,

Disorders the whole economy of my bed, leaves me half-naked,

And my whole night's comfort is the tuneable serenade of that wakeful nightingale, his nose!

Oh, the pleasure of counting the melancholy clock by a snoring husband!

But now, sister, you shall see how handsomely, being a well-bred man, he will beg my pardon. </p>

			<h2>'The Forced Marriage' by Moliere</h2>
			<p>Geronimo: If we take fifty-two from sixty-four, we get twelve; five years you spent in Holland, seventeen; seven years spent in England, twenty-four; eight years in Rome, thirty-two; and if to thirty-two we add your age when we first became acquainted, we have exactly fifty-two. So that, Mr. Sganarelle, according to your own confession, you are between fifty-two and fifty-three years of age. The calculation is exact enough. Now, I will tell you frankly, as a friend--according to the promise you made me give you--that marriage would suit you but little. Marriage is a thing about which young people ought to think long and seriously before they risk themselves, but of which people of your age ought not to think at all; and if, as some say, the greatest folly a man can commit is to marry, I know nothing more preposterous than to commit such a folly at a time of life when we should be most prudent. In short, to speak to you plainly, I advise you not to marry; and I should think you very ridiculous if, after having remained free up to your time of life, you were now to burden yourself with the heaviest of all chains. [Pause.] What's that? You're in love with her? Ah! That's quite another thing. You didn't tell me that. By all means marry, then; I haven't another word to say.</p>

The mean'st a gentleman, have offered up

Whole hecatombs of sighs, and rained in showers

Handfuls of gold; yet, for all this, at last

Diseases sucked her marrow, then grew so poor

That she has begged e'en at a beggar's door.

And (wherein heaven has a finger) when this idol,

From coast to coast, has leaped on foreign shores,

And had more worship than the outlandish whores;

When several nations have gone over her;

When, for each several city she has seen,

Her maidenhead has been new, and been sold dear;

Did live well there, and might have died unknown

And undefamed--back comes she to her own,

And there both miserably lives and dies,

Scorned even of those that once adored her eyes,

As if her fatal, circled life thus ran:

Her pride should end there where it first began.

Nay, if you spoil your cheeks, I'll read no more.</p>

			<p>Lady Bracknell: Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes. Well, Algernon, of course if you are obliged to be beside the bedside of Mr. Bunbury, I have nothing more to say. But I would be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.</p>

			<h2>'The Misanthrope' by Moliere</h2>
			<p>Alceste: No, you labour in vain, and in vain try to argue. Nothing can now deter me from my project; too much perversity reigns in our age, and I am resolved to avoid in future all intercourse with men. What! everyone sees that honour, probity, decency, and the laws are all against my adversary, men publish the justice of my cause, and my mind trusts to the certainty of my right! Yet in the end I am defeated! I have justice on my side, and I lose my cause! A miserable scoundrel, whose shameful history everyone knows, comes off triumphantly, thanks to the blackest falsehood! All good faith yields to his perfidy! He cuts my throat and proves that he is right. The weight of his mean, hypocritical grimace is thrown into the balance, and justice kicks the beam. He gets a decree of court to crown his infamy; and not satisfied with the injury done to me, as there circulates in the world an abominable book, the mere reading of which would be blamable, and which deserves the strictest suppression, the paltry scoundrel has the impudence to proclaim me the author! Upon which Oronte is seen to mutter, and basely endeavours to support the calumny! Oronte, who is said at Court to be an honourable man, and to whom I have done no other wrong than to have told him the honest truth. Oronte, who comes to me in spite of myself, eagerly to ask my opinion on verses of his making; and because I speak to him frankly, and betray neither him nor the truth, he helps to crush me with an imaginary crime! He becomes my greatest enemy, and will never forgive me, because, forsooth! I could not find his sonnet good. 'Sdeath! and men are made thus! It is to such actions that glory leads them! This is the good faith, virtuous zeal, justice, and honour we find among them! No, it is too much to endure all the sorrows their malice can devise against us; I will escape out of this wood, out of this cut-throat place; and since men behave like wolves to each other, the traitors shall never have me among them so long as I am alive.</p>

ActI Sc II Lucy (The Maid)</h2>
			<p>Lucy: Ha, ha, ha! So my dear simplicity, let me give you a little respite. (Altering her manner) Let girls in my station be as fond as they please of appearing expert and knowing in their trusts. Commend me to a mask of silliness and a pair of sharp eyes for my own interest under it! Let me see to what account I have turned my simplicity lately. (Looks at a paper) "For abetting Miss Lydia Languish in a design of running away with an ensign, in money - sundry times twelve pound twelve; gowns - five; hats, ruffles, caps etc. etc. - numberless! From the said ensign, within this last month, six guineas and a half" - about a quarter's pay! "Item, from  Mrs Malaprop, for betraying the young people to her" - when I found matters were likely to be discovered - "two guineas, and a black paduasoy. Item, from Mr Acres, for carrying divers letters" - which I never delivered - "two guineas and a pair of buckles. Item, from Sir Lucius O'Trigger, three crowns, two gold pocket-pieces, and a silver snuffbox! Well done, simplicity! Yet I was forced to make my Hibernian believe, that he was corresponding, not with the aunt, but with the niece: for, though not over-rich, I found he had too much pride and delicacy to sacrifice the feelings of a gentleman to the necessities of his fortune.</p>

			<h2>'The Rivals' by Richard Brinsley Sheridan</h2>
			<p>Mrs. Malaprop: Observe me, Sir Anthony. I would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning. I don't think so much learning becomes a young woman; for instance-I would never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or Algebra, or Simony, or Fluxions, or Paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches of learning. Neither would it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical, astronomical, or diabolical instruments. But, Sir Anthony, I would send her, at nine years old, to a boarding school in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice. Then, Sir, she should have a supercilious knowledge in accounts. And as she grew up, I would have her instructed in geometry that she might know something of the contagious countries. But above all, Sir Anthony, she should be mistress of orthodoxy; that she might not misspell and mispronounce words so shamefully as girls usually do. And likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning of what she is saying. This, Sir Anthony, is what I would have a woman know - and  I don't think there is a superstitious article in it!</p>

(Hearing Arkadina) And he's here... Yes... It doesn't matter... Yes... He didn't believe in the theatre, he went on mocking my dreams, and little by little I too stopped believing and lost heart...And then came the troubles of love, jealousy, the constant fear for my child...I became petty, worthless, I acted mindlessly...I didn't know what to do with my hand, didn't know how to stand on the stage, wasn't in control of my voice. You can't understand what it's like to feel you're acting terribly. I am a seagull. No, that's not right...Do you remember, you shot a seagull? A man just came along, saw it and killed it from having nothing to do...A plot for a short story. That's not right. What was I...? I was talking about the stage. Now I am not so...I am now a real actress, I act with enjoyment, with ecstasy, I get intoxicated on the stage and feel that I'm beautiful. And now, while I've been staying here, I've walked everywhere, I walk and walk, and think, think and feel how everyday my spiritual powers grow...Kostya, I know now, I understand. In what we do - whether we act on the stage or write - the most important thing isn't fame or glory or anything I used to dream about - but the ability to endure. To know how to bear your cross and have faith. I have faith, and my pain is less, and when I think about my vocation I'm not afraid of life.</p>

			<h2>'The Town Fop' by Aphra Behn</h2>
			<p>Sir Timothy: I vow to Fortune, Ned, thou must come to London, and be a little manag'd: 'slife,

Man, shouldst thou talk so aloud in good Company, thou wouldst be counted a strange Fellow.

Pretty--and drest with Love--a find Figure, by Fortune:

No, Ned, the painted Chariot gives a Lustre to every ordinary Face, and makes a Woman look like Quality;

Ay, so like, by Fortune, that you shall not know one from t'other, till some scandalous, out-of-favour'd laid-aside Fellow of the Town,

cry--Damn her for a Bitch--how scornfully the Whore regards me--

She has forgot since Jack--such a one,

and I, club'd for the keeping of her,

when both our Stocks well manag'd wou'd not amount to above seven Shillings six Pence a week;

besides now and then a Treat of a Breast of Mutton from the next Cook's.--

Then the other laughs, and crys--Ay, rot her--and tells his Story too, and concludes with,

Who manages the Jilt now; Why, faith, some dismal Coxcomb or other, you may be sure, replies the first.

But, Ned, these are Rogues, and Rascals, that value no Man's Reputation, because they despise their own.

But faith, I have laid aside all these Vanities, now I have thought of Matrimony;

but I desire my Reformation may be a Secret,

			<h2>'The Way of the World' by William Congreve</h2>
			<p>Millamant: Vanity! No-I'll fly and be followed to the last moment; though I am upon the very verge of matrimony, I expect you should solicit me as much as if I were wavering at the grate of a monastery, with one foot over the threshold. I'll be solicited to the very last; nay, and afterwards. Oh, I hate a lover that can dare to think he draws a moment's air independent on the bounty of his mistress. There is not so impudent a thing in nature as the saucy look of an assured man confident of success: the pedantic arrogance of a very husband has not so pragmatical an air. Ah, I'll never marry, unless I am first made sure of my will and pleasure. I'll lie a-bed in a morning as long as I please. And d'ye hear, I won't be called names after I'm married; positively I won't be called names-Ay, as "wife," "spouse," "my dear," "joy," "jewel," "love," "sweet-heart," and the rest of that nauseous cant, in which men and their wives are so fulsomely familiar-I shall never bear that. Good Mirabell, don't let us be familiar or fond, nor kiss before folks, like my Lady Fadler and Sir Francis; nor go to Hyde Park together the first Sunday in a new chariot, to provoke eyes and whispers, and then never be seen there together again, as if we were proud of one another the first week, and ashamed of one another ever after. Let us never visit together, nor go to a play together, but let us be very strange and well-bred. Let us be as strange as if we had been married a great while, and as well-bred as if we were not married at all. I must be at liberty to pay and receive visits to and from whom I please; to write and receive letters, without interrogatories or wry faces on your part; to wear what I please, and choose conversation with regard only to my own taste; to have no obligation upon me to converse with wits that I don't like, because they are your acquaintance, or to be intimate with fools, because they may be your relations. Come to dinner when I please, dine in my dressing-room when I'm out of humor, without giving a reason. To have my closet inviolate; to be sole empress of my tea-table, which you must never presume to approach without first asking leave. And lastly, wherever I am, you shall always knock at the door before you come in. These articles subscribed, if I continue to endure you a little longer, I may by degrees dwindle into a wife.</p>

Act V Sc I Annabella</h2>
			<p>Annabella: Pleasures, farewell, and all ye thriftless minutes
Wherein false joys have spun a weary life!
To these my fortunes now I take my leave.
Thou, precious Time, that swiftly rid'st in post
Over the world, to finish up the race
Of my last fate, here stay thy restless course,
And bear to ages that are yet unborn
A wretched, woeful woman's tragedy!

With depositions character'd in guilt,

And tells me I am lost: now I confess;
Beauty that clothes the outside of the face,
Is cursed if it be not cloth'd with grace.
Here like a turtle, (mew'd up in a cage,)
Unmated, I converse with air and walls,
And descant on my vile unhappiness.
O Giovanni, that hast had the spoil
Of thine own virtues, and my modest fame;
Would thou hadst been less subject to those stars
That luckless reign'd at my nativity!
O would the scourge, due to my black offence,
Might pass from thee, that I alone might feel
The torment of an uncontrouled flame!</p>

			<h2>'Twelfth Night' by William Shakespeare

Malvolio Act II Sc V</h2>
			<p>Malvolio: By my life, this is my lady's hand. These be her

very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her

great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.

 Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?

 (Reads)

"To the unknown beloved, this, and my good

wishes":-her very phrases! By your leave,

wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with

which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom

should this be?

 

               "Jove knows I love,

                    But who?

               Lips, do not move;

               No man must know."

 

"No man must know." What follows? the

numbers altered! "No man must know." If this

should be thee, Malvolio?

      "I may command where I adore;

           But silence, like a Lucrece knife,

      With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:

           M, O, A, I, doth sway my life."

 

."M, O, A, I, doth sway my life." Nay, but

first, let me see, let me see, let me see.

 

"I may command where I adore." Why, she may

command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why,

this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no

obstruction in this. And the end what should

that alphabetical position portend? If I could make

that resemble something in me! Softly! M, O, A, I,-

 M-Malvolio; M,-why, that begins my

name. M,-but then there is no consonancy in the

sequel that suffers under probation: A should

follow but O does. And then I comes behind.

M, O, A, I. This simulation is not as the former;

and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me,

for every one of these letters are in my name.

Soft, here follows prose.

(Reads)

 "If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am

above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are

born great, some achieve greatness, and some have

greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open their hands;

let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and, to inure

thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble

slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman,

surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of

state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus

advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who com-

mended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee

ever cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art

made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee

a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy

to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would

alter services with thee,

                The Fortunate-Unhappy."

Daylight and champaign discovers not more. This is

open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,

I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross

acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.

I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade

me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady

loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of

late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;

and in this she manifests herself to my love, and

with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits

of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will

be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-

gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on.

Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.

 (Reads)

 "Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou

entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;

thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my

presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee."

Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do

everything that thou wilt have me.</p>

That, as methought, her eyes had lost her tongue,

For she did speak in starts distractedly.

She loves me sure; the cunning of her passion

Invites me in this churlish messenger.

None of my lord's ring? Why, he sent her none.

Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,

For such as we are made of, such we be.

How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly;

And I (poor monster) fond as much on him;

And she (mistaken) seems to dote on me.

			<h2>'Volpone' by Ben Johnson

Act II Sc II Corvino</h2>
			<p>Corvino: Death of mine honour, with the city's fool!

A juggling, tooth-drawing, prating mountebank!

And at a public window! where, whilst he,

With his strained action, and his dole of faces,

To his drug-lecture draws your itching ears,

A crew of old, unmarried, noted lechers

Stood leering up like satyrs; and you smile

Most graciously, and fan your favours forth,

To give your hot spectators satisfaction!

What, was your mountebank their call? their whistle?

Or were y' enamoured on his copper rings?

His saffron jewel with the toad-stone in't?

Or his embroidered suit, with the cope-stitch,

Made of a hearse-cloth? or his old tilt-feather?

Or his starched beard? Well, you shall have him, yes!

He shall come home, and minister unto you

The fricace of the mother. Or, let me see,

I think you'd rather mount; would you not mount?

Why, if you'll mount, you may; yes, truly, you may!

And so you may be seen, down to th' foot.

Get you a cittern, Lady Vanity,

And be a dealer with the virtuous man;

Make one. I'll but protest myself a cuckold,

And save your dowry. I'm a Dutchman, I!

For if you thought me an Italian,

You would be damned ere you did this, you whore!

Thou'dst tremble to imagine that the murder

Of father, mother, brother, all thy race,

Should follow, as the subject of my justice!

I should strike this steel into thee, with as many stabs

As thou wert gazed upon with goatish eyes!

You were an actor, with your handkerchief,

Which he most sweetly kissed in the receipt,

And might, no doubt, return it with a letter,

And 'point the place where you might meet--your sister's,

Your mother's, or your aunt's might serve the turn.

And therefore mark me: thy restraint before

Was liberty To what I now decree.

First, I will have this bawdy light damned up;

And till't be done, some two or three yards off,

I'll chalk a line, o'er which if thou but chance

To set thy desp'rate foot, more hell, more horror,

More wild remorseless rage shall seize on thee,

Than on a conjuror that had heedless left

His circle's safety ere his devil was laid.

Then, here's a lock which I will hang upon thee;

And, now I think on't, I will keep thee backwards;

Thy lodging shall be backwards, thy walks backwards,

Thy prospect all be backwards, and no pleasure,

That thou shalt know, but backwards. Nay, since you force

My honest nature, know it is your own

Being too open, makes me use you thus;

Since you will not contain your subtle nostrils

In a sweet room, but they must snuff the air

Of rank and sweaty passengers!</p>

			<h1>Ballet</h1>
<p>Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and 
later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.</p>
<p>Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production. 
A well-known example of this is 'The Nutcracker,' a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa 
and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p>Stylistic variations have emerged and evolved since the Italian Renaissance. Early variations are primarily associated 
with geographic origin. Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian ballet.</p>
<p>Later variations include contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style 
is late Romantic ballet (or Ballet Blanc), which is a classical style that focuses on female dancers and features pointe work, 
flowing and precise acrobatic movements, and often presents the female dancers in traditional short white French tutus.</p>
<p>Ballet dance works (ballets) are choreographed and performed by trained artists, and often performed with classical music accompaniment.</p>
<p>Early ballets preceded the invention of the proscenium stage and were performed in large chambers with the audience seated on 
tiers or galleries on three sides of the dance floor.</p>
<p>Modern ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal).</p>
<p>Ballet requires years of training to learn and master, and much practice to retain proficiency. It has been taught in ballet schools around the world, 
which have historically used their own cultures to evolve the art.</p>
<p>The word ballet comes from the French and was borrowed into English around 1630. The French word in turn has its origin in Italian balletto, 
a diminutive of ballo (dance) which comes from Latin ballo, ballare, meaning "to dance". This in turn comes from the 
Greek "&Beta;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&zeta;&psi;" (ballizo) meaning "to dance" or "to jump about".</p>

			<h1>Black Comedy</h1>
<p>A black comedy, or dark comedy, is a comic work that employs black humor or gallows humor.</p>
<p>The term black humor (from the French humour noir) was coined by the Surrealist theoretician Andre Breton 
in 1935 to designate a sub-genre of comedy and satire in which laughter arises from cynicism and skepticism, often relying on topics such as death.</p>
Breton coined the term for his book Anthology of Black Humor (Anthologie de l'humour noir) in which he credited Jonathan Swift as the 
originator of black humour and gallows humour, and included excerpts from 45 other writers. 
Breton included both examples in which the wit arises from a victim with which the audience empathizes, 
as is more typical in the tradition of gallows humour, and examples in which the comedy is used to mock the victim, 
whose suffering is trivialized and leads to sympathising with the victimiser, as is the case with Sade.</p>
<p>Black humour is related to that of the grotesque genre.</p>
<p>Breton identified Swift as the originator of black humour and gallows humour, particularly in his pieces 'Directions to Servants' (1731), 
'A Modest Proposal' (1729), 'A Meditation Upon a Broom-Stick' (1710), and a few aphorisms .</p>
<p>The terms black comedy or dark comedy have been later derived as alternatives to Breton's term. In black humour topics 
and events that are usually regarded as taboo, specifically those related to death, are treated in an unusually humorous 
or satirical manner while retaining their seriousness; the intent of black comedy, therefore, is often for the audience to 
experience both laughter and discomfort, sometimes simultaneously.</p>
<p>The purpose of black comedy is to make light of serious and often taboo subject matter, and some comedians use it as a tool for 
exploring vulgar issues, thus provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience. 
Popular themes of the genre include murder, suicide, depression, abuse, mutilation, war, barbarism, drug abuse, 
terminal illness, domestic violence, sexual violence, paedophilia, insanity, nightmare, disease, racism, homophobia, sexism, 
disability (both physical and mental), chauvinism, corruption, and crime.</p>
<p>Comedians, like Lenny Bruce, that since the late 1950s have been labelled "sick comedy" by mainstream journalists, have also been labelled 
with "black comedy." After Lenny Bruce, comedians such as Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle and the Monty Python 
team have been associated with black comedy.</p>
<p>Black comedy is commonly used in dramatic or satirical films, retaining its serious tone, working as a tool of many films, 
television shows and video games. Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film 'Dr. Strangelove' presents one of the best-known mainstream examples of 
black comedy. The subject of the film is nuclear warfare and the possible annihilation of life on Earth. Normally, dramas about 
nuclear war treat the subject with gravity and seriousness, creating suspense over the efforts to avoid a nuclear war. 
'Dr. Strangelove' instead plays the subject for laughs. For example the fail-safe procedures designed to prevent a nuclear 
war are precisely the systems that ensure that it will happen. Plot-wise, Group Captain Mandrake serves as the only sane character 
in the film, while Major Kong fills the role of the hero striving for a harmful goal.</p>
<p>An example of a situation comedy that is also black comedy is 'M*A*S*H', which, like the film version of 'M*A*S*H' that had inspired it, 
treated the Korean War as a subject of black comedy. It deliberately kept recorded laughter out of the operating room sequences and many of 
the episodes described the absurdity of many combat situations, even in sequences where the characters were weathering hostile fire.</p>
<p>Examples of black comedy in the theatre are 'Arsenic and Old Lace' by Joseph Kesselring, 'The Lady Killers' by Alexander McKendrick originally 
a film for the Ealing studios, 'Waiting for Godot' by Samuel Beckett and 'Loot' by Joe Orton.</p>
<p>A modern day example are the 'Itchy and Scratchy' segments in 'The Simpsons'.</p>

			<h1>Commedia dell'Arte</h1>

<p>Commedia dell'Arte is a form of theatre characterized by masked types which began in Italy in the 16th century and was 
responsible for the advent of the actress and improvised performances based on sketches or scenarios.</p> 
<p>The closest translation of the name is comedy of craft. It is shortened from commedia dell'arte all'improvviso or 
comedy of the craft of improvisation. Here, arte does not refer to "art" as we currently consider the word, but rather 
to that which is made by artigiani (artisans). In fact, the term arte was coined much later, for in the early period the 
term used in contemporary accounts is commedia all'improviso. This was to distinguish the form from commedia erudita or 
learned comedy that was written by academics and performed by amateurs. Commedia dell'arte, conversely, 
was performed by professional actors (comici) who perfected a specific role or mask.</p>
<p>Italian theatre historians, such as Roberto Tessari, Ferdinando Taviani, and Luciano Pinto believe commedia was a 
response to the political and economic crisis of the 16th century and, as a consequence, became the first entirely professional form of theatre.</p>
<p>The performers played on outside, temporary stages, and relied on various props (robbe) in place of extensive scenery. The better troupes 
were patronized by nobility, and during carnival period might be funded by the various towns or cities in which they played. Extra 
funds were received by donations (essentially passing the hat) so anyone could view the performance free of charge. </p>
<p>Key to the success of the commedia was the ability of the performers to travel to achieve fame and financial success. 
The most successful troupes performed before kings and nobility allowing individual actors, such as Isabella Andreini and 
Dionisio Martinelli, to become well known.</p>
<p>The characters of the commedia usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, 
or military officers full of false bravado. Characters such as Pantalone, the miserly Venetian merchant; Dottore Gratiano, 
the pedant from Bologna; or Arlecchino, the mischievous servant from Bergamo, began as satires on Italian types and 
became the archetypes of many of the favourite characters of 17th and 18th century European theatre.</p>
<p>The commedia's genesis may be related to carnival in Venice, where by 1570 the author/actor Andrea Calmo had created the character 
'Il Magnifico', the precursor to the vecchio (old man) 'Pantalone'. In the Flaminio Scalascenari for example, 'Il Magnifico' 
persists and is interchangeable with 'Pantalone', into the seventeenth century. While Calmo's characters 
(which also included the Spanish 'Capitano' and a dottore type) were not masked, it is uncertain at what point the characters 
donned the mask. However, the connection to carnival (the period between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday) would suggest 
that masking was a convention of carnival and was applied at some point.</p>
<p>The tradition in Northern Italy is centred in Mantua, Florence, and Venice, where the major companies came under the aegis of the various dukes.  </p>
<p>Neapolitan tradition emerged in the south and featured the prominent stage figure 'Pulcinella'. 'Pulcinella' has been long 
associated with Naples, and derived into various types elsewhere, the most famous as the puppet character 'Punch' 
(of the eponymous 'Punch and Judy' shows) in England.</p>
<p>Commedia dell'arte has three main stock roles: servant, master, and innamorati (lovers), and the characters themselves are often 
referred to as "masks", which, according to John Rudlin, cannot be separated from the character. In other words the 
characteristics of the character and the characteristics of the mask are the same.</p> 
<p>The servants or the clowns are referred to as the 'Zanni' and include characters such as 'Arlecchino', 
'Brighella' and 'Pedrolino'. Some of the better known commedia dell'arte characters are 'Arlecchino' 
(also known as 'Harlequin'), 'Pierrot' and 'Pierrette', 'Pantalone',' Il Dottore', 'Brighella', 'Il Capitano', 
'Colombina', the 'Innamorati', 'Pedrolino', 'Pulcinella', 'Sandrone', 'Scaramuccia' (also known as 'Scaramouche'), 'il Somardino', 'La Signora', and 'Tartaglia'.</p>
<p>Conventional plot lines were written on themes of adultery, jealousy, love and old age. </p>
<p>Many of the basic plot elements can be traced back to the Roman comedies of Plautus and Terence, some of which were 
themselves translations of lost Greek comedies of the 4th century BC. However, it is more probable that the 
comici used contemporary novella, or, traditional sources as well, and drew from current events and local news of the day.</p> 
<p>Not all scenari were comic, there were some mixed forms and even tragedies. Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' is drawn from a popular scenario in the 
Scala collection, his 'Polonius' ('Hamlet') is drawn from 'Pantalone', and his clowns bear homage to the zanni.</p>
<p>Comici performed written comedies at court. Song and dance were widely used, and a number of innamorata were skilled madrigalists, 
a song form that uses chromatics and close harmonies. </p>
<p>Audiences came to see the performers, with plot lines becoming secondary to the performance. Among the great innamorate, 
Isabella Andreini was perhaps the most widely known and a medallion dedicated to her reads: "eternal fame." Tristano Martinelli 
achieved international fame as the first of the great 'Arlecchinos', and was honoured by the Medici and the Queen of France. </p>
<p>Performers made use of well-rehearsed jokes and stock physical gags, known as lazzi and concetti, as well as on-the-spot 
improvised and interpolated episodes and routines, called burle (singular 'burla', Italian for 'joke'), usually involving a practical joke.</p>
<p>Since the productions were improvised, dialogue and action could easily be changed to satirize local scandals, current events, 
or regional tastes, while still using old jokes and punch lines.</p>
<p>Characters were identified by costumes, masks, and props, such as a type of baton known as a slapstick. These characters included the 
forebears of the modern clown, namely 'Harlequin' ('Arlecchino') and 'Zanni'.</p>
<p>The classic, traditional plot is that the innamorati are in love and wish to be married, but one elder (vecchio) or several elders 
(vecchi) are preventing this from happening, leading the lovers to ask one or more zanni (eccentric servants) for help. Typically 
the story ends happily, with the marriage of the innamorati and forgiveness for any wrongdoings. There are countless variations 
on this story, as well as many that diverge wholly from the structure, such as a well-known story about 'Arlecchino' becoming mysteriously 
pregnant, or the 'Punch and Judy' scenario.</p>
<p>While generally personally unscripted, the performances often were based on scenarios that gave some semblance of plot to the largely improvised format. 
The Flaminio Scala scenarios, published in the early 17th century, are the most widely known collection and representative of its most esteemed compagnia,</p>

			<h1>Docudrama</h1>

<p>In radio and television programming and staged theatre, a docudrama is a documentary style genre that features dramatised re-enactments of actual historical events. </p>
<p>A docudrama may be filmed or written.</p>
<p>In the core elements of its story a docudrama strives to adhere to known historical facts, while allowing a greater or lesser degree of dramatic license in peripheral details, and where there are gaps in the historical record. </p>
<p>Docudrama producers sometimes choose to film their reconstructed events in the actual locations in which the historical events occurred. </p>
<p>Dialogue may include the actual words of real-life persons, as recorded in historical documents.</p>
<p>As a neologism, the term docudrama is often confused with docufiction. However, unlike docufiction, which is essentially a documentary filmed in real time, incorporating some fictional elements, docudrama is filmed at a time subsequent to the events it portrays. </p>
<p>Docudrama is also called documentary drama or it can be called Documentary Theatre.</p>
<p>Docudramas tend to demonstrate some or most of the following characteristics.</p>
<p>Focus on the facts of the event, as they are known.</p>
<p>Use of literary and narrative techniques to flesh out the bare facts of an event in history to tell a story.</p>
<p>Some degree of license may be taken with minor historical facts for the sake of enhancing the drama.</p>
<p>Uses Historical events and puts it on the stage.</p>
<p>A good docudrama does not abuse dramatic license, and avoids overt commentary and explicit assertion of the creator's own point of view or beliefs.</p>
<p>Docudramas are distinct from historical fiction, in which the historical setting is a mere backdrop for a plot involving fictional characters.</p>

			<h1>English Renaissance Theatre</h1>
<p>English Renaissance theatre, also known as early modern English theatre, refers to the theatre of England, largely based in London, which occurred between 1567, when the first English theatre 'The Red Lion' was opened; and the closure of the theatres in 1642. </p>
<p>It includes the drama of William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, John Webster, John Dekker and many other famous playwrights.</p>
<p>Along with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed toward the end of the period. Under Elizabeth, the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented toward the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. </p>
<p>By the later part of the reign of Charles I, few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.</p>
<p>The establishment of large and profitable public theatres was an essential enabling factor in the success of English Renaissance drama. Once they were in operation, drama could become a fixed and permanent rather than a transitory phenomenon. Their construction was prompted when the Mayor and Corporation of London first banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and then formally expelled all players from the city in 1575. This prompted the construction of permanent playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink, and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey. </p>
<p>The Theatre was constructed in Shoreditch in 1576 by James Burbage with his brother-in-law John Brayne (the owner of the unsuccessful Red Lion Playhouse of 1567) and the Newington Butts playhouse was set up, probably by Jerome Savage, some time between 1575 and 1577. The Theatre was rapidly followed by the nearby Curtain Theatre (1577), the Rose (1587), the Swan (1595), the Globe (1599), the Fortune (1600), and the Red Bull (1604). </p>
<p>Archaeological excavations on the foundations of the Rose and the Globe in the late twentieth century showed that all the London theatres had individual differences; yet their common function necessitated a similar general plan. </p>
<p>The public theatres were three stories high, and built around an open space at the centre. </p>
<p>Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect (though the Red Bull and the first Fortune were square), the three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open centre, into which jutted the stage-essentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience, only the rear being restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. </p>
<p>The upper level behind the stage could be used as a balcony, as in 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'Antony and Cleopatra', or as a position from which an actor could harangue a crowd, as in 'Julius Caesar'. </p>
<p>Usually built of timber, lath and plaster and with thatched roofs, the early theatres were vulnerable to fire, and were replaced (when necessary) with stronger structures. When the Globe burned down in June 1613, it was rebuilt with a tile roof; when the Fortune burned down in December 1621, it was rebuilt in brick (and apparently was no longer square). </p>
<p>A different model was developed with the Blackfriars Theatre, which came into regular use on a long-term basis in 1599. The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres and roofed rather than open to the sky; it resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not. </p>
<p>Other small enclosed theatres followed, notably the Whitefriars (1608) and the Cockpit (1617). With the building of the Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629 near the site of the defunct Whitefriars, the London audience had six theatres to choose from: three surviving large open-air "public" theatres, the Globe, the Fortune, and the Red Bull, and three smaller enclosed "private" theatres, the Blackfriars, the Cockpit, and the Salisbury Court. </p>
<p>Audiences of the 1630s benefited from a half-century of vigorous dramaturgical development; the plays of Marlowe and Shakespeare and their contemporaries were still being performed on a regular basis (mostly at the public theatres), while the newest works of the newest playwrights were abundant as well (mainly at the private theatres). </p>
<p>Around 1580, when both the Theatre and the Curtain were full on summer days, the total theatre capacity of London was about 5000 spectators. With the building of new theatre facilities and the formation of new companies, the capital's total theatre capacity exceeded 10,000 after 1610.</p>
<p>In 1580, the poorest citizens could purchase admittance to the Curtain or the Theatre for a penny; in 1640, their counterparts could gain admittance to the Globe, the Cockpit, or the Red Bull-for exactly the same price. (Ticket prices at the private theatres were five or six times higher)</p>
<p>One distinctive feature of the companies was that they included only males. Until the reign of Charles II, female parts were played by adolescent boy players in women's costume.</p>
<p>Costumes were often bright in colour and visually entrancing. Costumes were expensive, however, so usually players wore contemporary clothing regardless of the time period of the play. Otherwise, costumes would be recycled and used in multiple different plays multiple times until it was too worn to be used. Occasionally, a lead character would wear a conventionalized version of more historically accurate garb, but secondary characters would nonetheless remain in contemporary clothing.</p>
<p>Genres of the period included the history play, which depicted English or European history. Shakespeare's plays about the lives of kings, such as 'Richard III' and 'Henry V', belong to this category, as do Christopher Marlowe's 'Edward II' and George Peele's 'Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First'. History plays dealt with more recent events, like 'A Larum for London' which dramatizes the sack of Antwerp in 1576.</p>
<p>Tragedy was an amazingly popular genre. Marlowe's tragedies were exceptionally popular, such as 'Dr. Faustus' and 'The Jew of Malta'. The audiences particularly liked revenge dramas, such as Thomas Kyd's 'The Spanish Tragedy.' The four tragedies considered to be Shakespeare's greatest ('Hamlet', 'Othello', 'King Lear', and 'Macbeth') were composed during this period, as well as many others.</p>
<p>Comedies were common, too. A sub-genre developed in this period was the city comedy, which deals satirically with life in London after the fashion of Roman New Comedy. Examples are Thomas Dekker's 'The Shoemaker's Holiday' and Thomas Middleton's 'A Chaste Maid in Cheapside'.</p>
<p>Though marginalised, the older genres like pastoral ('The Faithful Shepherdess', 1608), and even the morality play ('Four Plays in One', ca. 1608-13) could exert influences. </p>
<p>After about 1610, the new hybrid sub-genre of the tragicomedy enjoyed an efflorescence, as did the masque throughout the reigns of the first two Stuart kings, James I and Charles I.</p>
<p>The rising Puritan movement was hostile toward theatre, as they felt that "entertainment" was sinful. Politically, playwrights and actors were clients of the monarchy and aristocracy, and most supported the Royalist cause. The Puritan faction, long powerful in London, gained control of the city early in the English Civil War, and on September 2, 1642 ordered the closure of the London theatres. The theatres remained closed for most of the next eighteen years, re-opening after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The re-opened theatres performed many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms; new genres of Restoration comedy and spectacle soon evolved, giving English theatre of the later seventeenth century its distinctive character.</p>

			<h1>Epic Theatre</h1>
<p>A theatrical movement arising in the early to mid-20th century from the theories and practice of a number of theatre practitioners, including Erwin Piscator, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold and, most famously, Bertolt Brecht. </p>
<p>Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the style, and popularized it. </p>
<p>Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what he calls gestus. </p>
<p>The epic form describes both a type of written drama and a methodological approach to the production of plays:  </p>
<p>Brecht later preferred the term "dialectical theatre" </p>
<p>One of the goals of epic theatre is for the audience to always be aware that it is watching a play</p>
<p>Epic theatre was a reaction against popular forms of theatre, particularly the naturalistic approach pioneered by Constantin Stanislavski. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of melodrama; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of Stanislavski's system and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw Stanislavski's methodology as producing escapism. </p>
<p>Brecht's own social and political focus departed also from surrealism and the Theatre of Cruelty, as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of Antonin Artaud, who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally.</p>
<p>One of the most important techniques Brecht developed to perform epic theatre was the alienation effect, or the Verfremdungseffekt. The purpose of this technique was to make the audience feel detached from the action of the play, so they do not become immersed in the fictional reality of the stage or become overly empathetic of the character. Flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage), having actors play multiple characters, having actors also rearrange the set in full view of the audience and "breaking the fourth wall" by speaking to the audience are all ways he used to achieve the Verfremdungseffekt.</p>
<p>As with the principle of dramatic construction involved in the epic form of written drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls "non-Aristotelian drama", the epic approach to play production utilizes a montage technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and interruptions. </p>
<p>Brecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a music hall turn that is able to stand on its own. Common production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic scenic design offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. </p>
<p>Brecht used comedy to distance his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers, putting music and song in his plays.</p>
<p>Acting in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have "become" the characters. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character ("breaking the fourth wall") and play multiple roles. </p>
<p>Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another. For example, a character could say, "I could have stayed at home, but instead I went to the shops." This he called "fixing the Not / But element."</p>

			<h1>Farce</h1>
<p>In theatre, a farce is a comedy which aims at entertaining the audience by means of unlikely, extravagant, and improbable situations, disguise and mistaken identity, verbal humour of varying degrees of sophistication, which may include word play, and a fast-paced plot whose speed usually increases, culminating in an ending which often involves an elaborate chase scene. </p>
<p>Farces are often highly incomprehensible plot-wise (due to the large number of plot twists and random events that often occur), but viewers are encouraged not to try to follow the plot in order to avoid becoming confused and overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Farce is also characterized by physical humour, the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances. </p>
<p>Farces have been written for the stage and film.</p>
<p>Japan has a centuries-old tradition of farce plays called Kyogen. These plays are performed as comic relief during the long, serious Noh plays.</p>
<p>The word farce derives from old French, meaning 'stuff' or 'stuffing' and may have originated in the comic interludes of medieval French religious plays serving as light-hearted stuffing in between more serious drama. Historically, the term meant a literary or artistic production of little merit.</p>
<p>Farce is a type of comedy that uses absurd and highly improbable events in the plot. Situations are humorous because of their ludicrous and often ridiculous nature. The choice of setting is a key factor in farce, as the protagonist is sometimes at odds with the environment. Often the central character in a farce does not (or should not) belong in the place of the action. The audience will only accept the situation if they follow the conventions previously established. But characters in a farce can also quite logically belong in the setting they are placed in.</p>
<p>Examples of farce can be found in the ancient Greek comedies of Aristophanes, the plays of Shakespeare and the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan, 'Noises Off' by Michael Frayn and 'What the Butler Saw' by Joe Orton.</p>
<p>Farce in film includes the works of Charlie Chaplin, Keystone Cops and the Marx Brothers. </p>
<p>On television, the best examples of farce surround British actor John Cleese. Ridiculous situations abound in the 1970's television series Monty Python's Flying Circus and later in the wonderful, but short-lived series 'Fawlty Towers'. There are also several Monty Python films that are excellent examples of farce. </p>
<p>It is important to note that farce is both a verbal and physical humour, using deliberate character exaggeration by the actor. The Marx Brothers were renowned for using their bodies in such a way as to exaggerate the situation, thus making it even more farcical. Whether it was using on-screen props or simply their arms and legs, this famous team made farce a very physical form of comedy. </p>

			<h1>Feminist Theatre</h1>
<p>Feminist theatre is a performance point of view that shows the oppression of women under men, and urges society to challenge the norms and fight for gender equality by showing the strength and weaknesses in female characters and the fates they face as a cause of this.</p>
<p>An example of feminist theatre is Henrik Ibsen's 'Nora' from "A Dolls House", who after realizing that the place she is expected to take in society is one that she cannot live with, leaves her husband and children.</p>
<p>Another example is 'Top Girls' by Caryl Churchil</p>
<p>Born out of an intersection between the experimental theatre movement of the 1960s and the feminist movement of the 1970s, feminist theatre is as much a political endeavor as a theatrical one. Like the postmodern, with which it is closely associated-some might even say it is but one branch on the postmodern tree-feminist theatre argues that for over two millennia, since even before Aristotle scribbled out his 'Poetics', Western theatre has been dominated by a white, male ideology. </p>
<p>With its focus on a single protagonist, its belief that identity and gender (and thus character) are fixed and singular, and its dearth of substantive female roles, the Western theatre has perpetuated a masculine perspective of the world at the expense of the feminine. In response, feminist theatre evolved not only to share the tragically under-represented experiences of women living in a patriarchal society, but also to create a theatricality that would subvert Western theatre's most "sacred" traditions.</p>
<p>Churchill's 'Top Girl's', as an example, undermines the Aristotelian aesthetic-in which a single protagonist follows a linear plot-by focusing on an ensemble during its opening dinner scene, thus dramatizing the feminist belief that the group is more important than the individual. The drama here is not born out of conflict, but rather out of the juxtaposition of the characters and the stories they share.  It is the collision of Patient Griselda, for instance, whose husband continually tests her loyalty by taking away her children, with that of Pope Joan, who disguised herself as a man and served as Pope between 854 and 856, that produces meaning in the play.</p>
<p>Also embedded in the structure of many feminist plays is the argument that identity and gender are not fixed or innate, but rather dynamic and culturally created. Signaling this are gestures like "doubling", in which an actor plays multiple parts in order to underscore the many potential identities inside a person, or cross-dressing, in which the incongruity of dressing up in "drag" highlights the "cultural performance" of gender.</p>
<p>These devices, along with a preference for non-linear plots and open-ended conclusions as opposed to climaxes, are just some of the elements that comprise the feminist theatre. </p>

			<h1>Greek Tragedy</h1>
<p>The Greek tragedy is a theatre genre born in Ancient Greece reaching its most significant form in Athens in the 5th century BC. It developed from religious rites of Ancient Greece and
Asia Minor in honour of Dionysus acquiring theatrical characteristics and continued until Romanticism which started a discussion about literary genres more than
Renaissance had done.</p>
<p> The basis of tragic plots were most often myths treated in the oral traditions of archaic epics, but in tragedy, these narratives were presented and received in a
quite different manner. The mythos (&#956;&#973;&#952;&#959;&#962;, "word, account") merges with the action, that is, with direct representation
(&#948;&#961;&#8118;&#956;&#945; "drama", derived from &#948;&#961;&#8048;&#969;, "to
act"), and the public sees with its own eyes characters that appear as separate entities and act autonomously on the        
stage (&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#942;), each provided with an individual psychological dimension.</p>
<p>
The most important and recognized authors of tragedies were Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, 
who dealt with the most heartfelt themes of Greece in the 5th century BC.</p>
<p>
Aristotle writes in the 'Poetics' that tragedy was born from the beginning improvisation, namely "by those who chant the dithyramb" 
(&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957;&#7952;&#958;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#952;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#957;, ap&#242;
ton exarch&#242;nt&#333;n t&#242;n dith&#253;rambon), a song choir in honour of Dionysus. These events were brief and burlesque in tone because they
contained elements of satyr. Gradually the language became more severe and the meter
changed from trochaic tetrameter to the more prosaic iambic trimeter. In the Stories (I, 23) of Herodotus and later sources, the lyric Arione 
Methymna is defined as the inventor of the dithyramb.</p>
<p>The Ditirambo was originally improvised, but later written before performance. The choir was directed to the thymele
(&#952;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#955;&#951;), the sacrificial altar, and sang in a circle around it.</p>
<p>Scholars have made a number of assumptions about the way in which it is accomplished by changing the dithyramb to tragedy. In general, it is
believed that at some point the Choir who sang this song in honour of Dionysus on Coryphaeus, was removed and replaced with a real
character who talked with other characters. Later was added another character, who did not sing but he spoke, called hypocrites (&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#942;&#962;, or "he responds that" a word
    that will result in the meaning of actor). Probably, the dialogue between the actor was born in this way, coryphaeus and choir gave birth to tragedy. From
    epic song-lyric, dithyramb becomes theatre.
</p>
<p>Tradition attributes to Thespis the first tragic representation, took place in 534
        BC during the Dionysia established by Peisistratus. Of his tragedies we
        know little except that the choir was still formed by Satyrs and that, according to
        Aristotle, he was the first to win a dramatic contest, and the first to introduce an actor (&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;)
        who portrayed a character rather than speaking as himself. Moreover Themistius, writer of the 4th century BC, reports that Thespis invented the
prologue and the spoken part (&#8165;&#8134;&#963;&#953;&#962;). The other playwrights of the time were Choerilus, author of probably one hundred and sixty
        tragedies (with thirteen wins), and Pratinas of Phlius author of fifty works of
        which 32 satyr plays, the But when we have received just the titles. From that moment the satyr plays alongside the representation of tragedies.
        Pratina definitely competed with Aeschylus and worked from 499 BC.
<p>
By Phrynichus, we start to get more information. Aristophanes sings his praises in his plays; in 'The Wasps' presents him as a radical democrat close to Themistocles. Besides
        introducing the dialogues iambic trimeter and use for the first time
female characters, invented the genre of tragedy to historical argument (Capture of Miletus), introducing a second part: you started,
        then the trilogy, which will be finally adopted by Aeschylus and his contemporaries.
        His first victory in a shad was in 510 BC
    </p>
<p>Aeschylus was to establish the basic rules of tragic drama. He is credited with introducing the second actor, which made possible the dramatization
    of a conflict, and trilogy linked through three tragedies that tell one long story. The
tragedies were performed in sequence over a full day, sunrise to sunset. At the end of the trilogy, was finally staged a satyr to revive the spirit of public, darkened by the tragic events.
</p>
<p>In the work of Aeschylus, comparing the first tragedies with those of subsequent years, we see an evolution and enrichment of the proper elements of
    tragic drama: dialogue, contrasts, theatrical effects. This is due to the competition that had the old Aeschylus in dramatic competition, especially from
    young Sophocles, which introduced a third actor, made more complex plots and
    developed characters more human, in which the audience could identify.
</p>
<p>Aeschylus showed at least partially receptive to innovations sofoclee, but remained faithful to a very strict morality and a very intense
    religiosity, which has its pivot in Zeus (which in Aeschylus is always the bearer of the
    properly of thinking and acting). Musically Aeschylus remains tied to the nomoi, rhythmic and melodic structures developed in the Archaic period.
</p>
<p>Plutarch
        , in the 'Life of Cimon', recounts his first triumph of the young talented Sophocles against the famous and hitherto unchallenged Aeschylus, which
ended in an unusual manner, without the usual draw for the referees, and that caused the voluntary exile of Aeschylus        
Sicily. The innovations introduced Sophocles, and that earned him at least twenty
        triumphs, were in many aspects of the tragic representation, the most insignificant details (like the white shoes and curved sticks) to reform denser
        consequences. Introduced a third actor, which allowed the tragedy to multiply the number of people possible, increased to fifteen the number of chorus
members, broke the obligation of the trilogy, making possible the representation of independent dramas, introduced the use of        
scenes.
    </p>
<p>Compared to Aeschylus, the tragic choruses sofoclei you steal away from the action, and become actively involved in fewer than spectators and
    commentators of the facts. Sophocles tried to remove the emphasis (onkos / &#8004;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#962;) to his characters, to completely restore the
drama, in a world described as unfair and devoid of light. In 'Oedipus at Colonus', the chorus repeats "the better lot is not
    born." The events that overwhelm the lives of the heroes are in no way be explained or justified, and in this we see the beginning of a painful reflection
    on the human condition, still current in the contemporary world.
</p>
<p>The peculiarities that distinguish the Euripidean tragedies from those of the other two playwrights are on one hand the search for technical
experimentation carried out by Euripides in almost all his works and he puts more attention in the description of feelings, of which analyzes the evolution that 
follows the change in events.
</p>
<p>The experimentation carried out by Euripides in his tragedies can be observed mainly in three aspects that characterize his theatre: the prologue,
which becomes more of a monologue that informs sull'antefatto exhibition, the introduction of deus ex machina and the gradual devaluation of the choir from the
    dramatic point of view in favour of the monody sung by the characters.
</p>
<p>The novelty of Euripidean drama is still represented by realism with which the playwright portrays the dynamics psychology of his characters. 
The hero described in his tragedies is no longer the
    resolute character of the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles, but often a difficult and insecure person, not without internal conflicts. The female
protagonists of the plays, such as 'Andromache', 'Phaedra' and '    Medea', the new figures are tragic Euripides, which he skilfully portrays the tormented
    sensitivity and irrational impulses that collide with the world of reason.
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Greek tragedy is structured according to a rigid schedule, which you can define the forms accurately. The tragedy usually begins with a prologue
    (from pro and logos, speech preliminary), in which one or more characters introduce the drama and explain the background, followed by the parodos (&#7969;
    &#960;&#940;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;), which is a part of Chorus made
    while it enters through the side corridors, the parodos, the real stage action then
    unfolds through three or more episodes (epeis&#242;dia), interspersed by stasimi, the interludes in which the chorus says or explains the situation that is
    developing on the scene (or, more rarely, performs actions); the tragedy ends with the Exodus (&#7956;&#958;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;), which shows the
    dissolution of the story.
</p>
<p>The performances of the tragedies took place in Athens on the occasion of the great Dionysia, feasts in honour of
Dionysus celebrated in the month of Elafebolione, towards the end of March. The Dionysia was organized by the State and the '
   
        archon eponymous
   
    , just assumed the charge, arranged to pick three of the richest citizens to entrust the "codirected", i.e. the construction of a tragic chorus: in
    democratic the wealthy citizens were required to fund public services such as "liturgy",
    that is as special tax.
</p>
<p>
        During the Dionysia took place a shad tragic, that is a race between three poets, chosen
dall'arconte eponymous perhaps based on a provisional script, each of which had to submit a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a satyr, 
each tetralogy was recited in the same day from the morning, so that the tragedy,
        lasted three days, while the fourth day was dedicated to the staging of five comedies. At the end of three days of competition was attributed an award
        to the best choir, to the best actor and best author. The system used provided that juries were composed of ten people (not experts, but ordinary
        citizens chosen by lot according to a rather complex procedure). At the end of the performances, the judges placed in an urn with a tablet inscribed
        the name of the winner chosen. Finally, five tablets were randomly selected, and only according to that was proclaimed the winner. In this way the
        final classification was influenced not only by the choice of the jurors, but also in part by luck.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Shows the population participated in the mass and probably in the 5th century BC were admitted women, children and slaves. The passion of the Greeks
    for the tragedy was overwhelming: Athens, said the critics, spending more for theatre than for the fleet. When the cost for the shows became sensitive
    content was set admission price, alongside the so-called
    Theory
    , a special fund to pay for a ticket to the poor.

			<h1>Japanese Noh Theatre</h1>
<p>Noh (&#33021;), or Nogaku (&#33021;&#27005;N&#333;gaku) derived from the Sino-Japanese word for "skill" or "talent" is a major form of classical Japanese musical drama that has been performed since the 14th century. 
<p>Many characters are masked, with men playing male and female roles. Traditionally, a Noh "performance day" lasts all day and consists of five Noh plays interspersed with shorter, humorous kyogen pieces. However, present-day Noh performances often consist of two Noh plays with one Kyogen play in between.
<p>While the field of Noh performance is extremely codified, and regulated by the iemoto system, with an emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, some performers do compose new plays or revive historical ones that are not a part of the standard repertoire. Works blending Noh with other theatrical traditions have also been produced.
<p>Together with the closely related kyogen farce, Noh evolved from various popular, folk and aristocratic art forms, including Dengaku, Shirabyoshi, and Gagaku.
<p>Kan'ami and his son Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is essentially its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) under the patronage of the powerful Ashikaga clan, particularly the third shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. It would later influence other dramatic forms such as Kabuki and Butoh. During the Meiji era, although its governmental patronage was lost, Noh and kyogen received official recognition as two of the three national forms of drama.
<p>By tradition, Noh actors and musicians only rehearse together once, a few days before the actual performance. Generally, each actor, musician, and chorus member practises his or her fundamental movements, songs, and dances independently, under the tutelage of a senior member of the school. Thus, the mood of a given performance is not set by any single performer but established by the interactions of all the performers together. In this way, Noh could be seen as exemplifying the medieval Japanese aesthetics of transience, exemplified by the saying of Sen no Rikyu, "ichi-go ichi-e", "one chance, one meeting".
<p>One of the important centres of Noh was Nagoya, which upholds its tradition in today's Nagoya Noh Theatre.
<p>There are four major categories of Noh performers: shite, waki, kyogen, and hayashi. 
<p>Shite (&#20181;&#25163;, &#12471;&#12486;). In plays where the shite appears first as a human and then as a ghost, the first role is known as the maeshite and the later as the nochishite.
<p>Shitetsure (&#20181;&#25163;&#36899;&#12428;, &#12471;&#12486;&#12485;&#12524;). The shite's companion. Sometimes shitetsure is abbreviated to tsure (&#36899;&#12428;, &#12484;&#12524;), although this term refers to both the shitetsure and the wakitsure.
<p>Koken (&#24460;&#35211;) are stage hands, usually one to three people.
<p>Jiutai (&#22320;&#35617;) is the chorus, usually comprising six to eight people.
<p>Waki (&#33031;, &#12527;&#12461;) performs the role that is the counterpart or foil of the shite.
<p>Wakitsure (&#33031;&#36899;&#12428;, &#12527;&#12461;&#12485;&#12524;) or Waki-tsure is the companion of the waki.
<p>Kyogen (&#29378;&#35328;) perform the aikyogen (&#30456;&#29378;&#35328;) interludes during plays. Kyogen actors also perform in separate plays between individual noh plays.
<p>Hayashi (&#22211;&#23376;) or hayashi-kata (&#22211;&#23376;&#26041;) are the instrumentalists who play the four instruments used in Noh theater: the transverse flute (&#23567;&#40723; fue), hip drum (&#22823;&#40723; otsuzumi) or okawa (&#22823;&#30382;), the shoulder-drum (&#23567;&#40723; kotsuzumi), and the stick-drum (&#22826;&#40723; taiko ). The flute used for noh is specifically called nokan or nohkan (&#33021;&#31649;).
<p>A typical Noh play always involve the chorus, the orchestra, and at least one shite and one waki actor.
<p>Noh plays are divided by theme into the following five categories, which are numbered in this order and referred to by these numbers (a "3rd group play", for instance).
<p>Kami mono (&#31070;&#29289;) or waki no (&#33031;&#33021;) typically feature the shite in the role of a human in the first act and a deity in the second and tell the mythic story of a shrine or praise a particular spirit.
<p>Shura mono (&#20462;&#32645;&#29289;) or ashura no (&#38463;&#20462;&#32645;&#33021;, warrior plays) have the shite often appearing as a ghost in the first act and a warrior in full battle regalia in the second, re-enacting the scene of his death.
<p>Katsura mono (&#39704;&#29289;, wig plays) or onna mono (&#22899;&#29289;, woman plays) depict the shite in a female role and feature some of the most refined songs and dances in all of Noh.
<p>There are about 94 "miscellaneous" plays, including kyoran mono (&#29378;&#20081;&#29289;) or madness plays, onryo mono (&#24616;&#38666;&#29289;) or vengeful ghost plays, and genzai mono (&#29694;&#22312;&#29289;), plays which depict the present time, and which do not fit into the other categories.
<p>Kiri no (&#20999;&#12426;&#33021;, final plays) or oni mono (&#39740;&#29289;, demon plays) usually feature the shite in the role of monsters, goblins, or demons, and are often selected for their bright colors and fast-paced, tense finale movements.
<p>Mugen no (&#22818;&#24187;&#33021;) usually deals with spirits, ghosts, phantasms, and supernatural worlds. Time is often depicted as passing in a non-linear fashion, and action may switch between two or more timeframes from moment to moment.
<p>Genzai no (&#29694;&#22312;&#33021;), as mentioned above, depicts normal events of the everyday world. However, when contrasted with mugen instead of with the other four categories, the term encompasses a somewhat broader range of plays.
<p>Geki no (&#21127;&#33021;) or drama plays are based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action.
<p>Furyu no (&#39080;&#27969;&#33021;) or dance plays focus rather on the aesthetic qualities of the dances and songs which are performed.
<p>Okina (or Kamiuta) is a unique play which combines dance with Shinto ritual. It is considered the oldest type of Noh play, and is probably the most often performed. It will generally be the opening work at any programme or festival.
<p>The traditional Noh stage consists of a pavilion whose architectural style is derived from that of the traditional kagura stage of Shinto shrines, and is normally composed almost entirely of hinoki (Japanese cypress) wood. 
<p>The four pillars are named for their orientation to the prominent actions during the course of the play: the waki-bashira in the front, right corner near the waki's standing point and sitting point; the shite-bashira in the rear, left corner, next to which the shite normally performs; the fue-bashira in the rear, right corner, closest to the flute player; and the metsuke-bashira, or "looking-pillar", so called because the shite is typically faced toward the vicinity of the pillar.
<p>The floor is polished to enable the actors to move in a gliding fashion, and beneath this floor are buried giant pots or bowl-shaped concrete structures to enhance the resonant properties of the wood floors when the actors stomp heavily on the floor (compare nightingale floor). As a result, the stage is elevated approximately three feet above the ground level of the audience.
<p>The only ornamentation on the stage is the kagami-ita, a painting of a pine tree at the back of the stage. The two most common beliefs are that it represents either a famous pine tree of significance in Shinto at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara, or that it is a token of Noh's artistic predecessors which were often performed to a natural backdrop.
<p>Another unique feature of the stage is the hashigakari, the narrow bridge to the right of the stage that the principal actors use to enter the stage. This would later evolve into the hanamichi in kabuki.
<p>All stages which are solely dedicated to Noh performances also have a hook or loop in ceiling, which exists only to lift and drop the bell for the play Dojoji. When that play is being performed in another location, the loop or hook will be added as a temporary fixture.
<p>The garb worn by actors is typically adorned quite richly and steeped in symbolic meaning for the type of role (e.g. thunder gods will have hexagons on their clothes while serpents have triangles to convey scales). Costumes for the shite in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are progressively less sumptuous for the tsure, the wakizure, and the aikyogen.
<p>For centuries, in accordance with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, whether that be the formal robes of a courtier or the street clothing of a peasant or commoner. It was not until the late sixteenth century that stylized Noh costumes following certain symbolic and stylistic conventions became the norm. 
<p>The musicians and chorus typically wear formal montsuki kimono (black and adorned with five family crests) accompanied by either hakama (a skirt-like garment) or kami-shimo, a combination of hakama and a waist-coat with exaggerated shoulders (see illustrations). Finally, the stage attendants are garbed in virtually unadorned black garments, much in the same way as stagehands in contemporary Western theatre.
<p>Noh masks all have names. They are carved from blocks of Japanese cypress (? "hinoki"), and painted with natural pigments on a neutral base of glue and crunched seashell.
<p>Usually only the shite, the main actor, wears a mask. However, in some cases, the tsure may also wear a mask, particularly in the case of female roles. Noh masks portray female or nonhuman (divine, demonic, or animal) characters. There are also Noh masks to represent youngsters or old men. On the other hand, a Noh actor who wears no mask plays a role of an adult man in his twenties, thirties, or forties. The side player, the waki, wears no mask either.
<p>Several types of masks, in particular those for female roles, are designed so that slight adjustments in the position of the head can express a number of emotions such as fear or sadness due to the variance in lighting and the angle shown towards the audience. With some of the more extravagant masks for deities and monsters, however, it is not always possible to convey emotion. Usually, however, these characters are not frequently called to change emotional expression during the course of the scene, or show emotion through larger body language.
<p>The rarest and most valuable Noh masks are not held in museums even in Japan, but rather in the private collections of the various "heads" of Noh schools; these treasures are usually only shown to a select few and only taken out for performance on the rarest occasions. This does no substantial harm to the study and appreciation of Noh masks, as tradition has established a few hundred standard mask designs, which can further be categorized as being one of about a dozen different types.
<p>The most commonly used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi. In either case, the fan is usually placed at the performer's side when he or she takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage.
<p>Several plays have characters who wield mallets, swords, and other implements. Nevertheless, during dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, including one such as a sword which the actor may have tucked in his sash or ready at hand nearby.
<p>When hand props other than fans are used, they are usually introduced or retrieved by stage attendants who fulfill a similar role to stage crew in contemporary theatre. Like their Western counterparts, stage attendants for Noh traditionally dress in black, but unlike in Western theatre they may appear on stage during a scene, or may remain on stage during an entire performance, in both cases in plain view of the audience.
<p>Stage properties in Noh including the boats, wells, altars, and the aforementioned bell from Dojoji, are typically carried onto the stage before the beginning of the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the aikyogen interlude.
<p>Noh theatre is accompanied by a chorus and a hayashi ensemble (Noh-bayashi &#33021;&#22211;&#23376;). Noh is a chanted drama, and a few commentators have dubbed it "Japanese opera". However, the singing in Noh involves a limited tonal range, with lengthy, repetitive passages in a narrow dynamic range. Clearly, melody is not at the centre of Noh singing. Still, texts are poetic, relying heavily on the Japanese seven-five rhythm common to nearly all forms of Japanese poetry, with an economy of expression, and an abundance of allusion. The singing parts of Noh are called "Utai" and the speaking parts "Kataru".
<p>It is important to note that the chant is not always performed "in character"; that is, sometimes the actor will speak lines or describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator. Far from breaking the rhythm of the performance, this is actually in keeping with the other-worldly feel of many Noh plays, especially those characterized as mugen.
<p>Noh hayashi ensemble consists of four musicians, also known as the "hayashi-kata". There are three drummers, which play the shime-daiko, otsuzumi (hip drum), and kotsuzumi (shoulder drum) respectively, and a shinobue flautist.
<p>One of the most subtle performance elements of Noh is that of Jo-ha-kyu, which originated as the three movements of courtly gagaku. However, rather than simply dividing a whole into three parts, within Noh the concept incorporates not only the play itself, but the songs and dances within the play, and even the individual steps, motions, and sounds that actors and musicians make. Furthermore, from a higher perspective, the entire traditional Noh program of five plays also manifests this concept, with the first type play being the jo, the second, third, and fourth plays the ha (with the second play being referred to as the jo of the ha, the third as the ha of the ha, and the fourth as the kyu of the ha), and finally the fifth play the kyu. In general, the jo component is slow and evocative, the ha component or components detail transgression or the disordering of the natural way and the natural world, and the kyu resolves the element with haste or suddenness (note, however, that this only means kyu is fast in comparison with what came before it, and those unfamiliar with the concepts of Noh may not even realize the acceleration occurred).

			<h1>Kitchen Sink</h1>
<p>Kitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama) is a term coined to describe a British cultural movement which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film and television plays, whose 'heroes' usually could be described as angry young men. </p>
<p>It used a style of social realism, which often depicted the domestic situations of working-class Britons living in rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies.</p>
<p>The films, plays, and novels employing this style are set frequently in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the rough-hewn speaking accents and slang heard in those regions. The film 'It Always Rains on Sunday' (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and the John Osborne play 'Look Back in Anger' (1956) is thought of as the first of the idiom. </p>
<p>Another important writer in the movement is Paddy Chayefsky.</p>
<p>The gritty love-triangle of 'Look Back in Anger', for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as 'Coronation Street' and 'EastEnders'. </p>
<p>In art, "Kitchen Sink School" was a term used by critic David Sylvester to describe painters who depicted social realist-type scenes of domestic life.</p>
<p>The cultural movement was rooted in the ideals of social realism, an artistic movement, expressed in the visual and other realist arts, which depicts working class activities. Many artists who subscribed to social realism were painters with socialist political views.  While the movement has some commonalities with Socialist Realism, the "official art" advocated by the governments of the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, the two had several differences.</p>
<p>Unlike Socialist realism, social realism is not an official art produced by, or under the supervision of the government. The leading characters are often 'anti-heroes' rather than part of a class to be admired, as in Socialist realism. Typically, they are dissatisfied with their lives and the world-rather than being idealised workers who are part of a Socialist utopia (supposedly) in the process of creation. As such, social realism allows more space for the subjectivity of the author to be displayed.</p>
<p>In the UK, the term "kitchen sink" derived from an expressionist painting by John Bratby, which contained an image of a kitchen sink. The critic David Sylvester wrote an article in 1954 about trends in recent English art, calling his article "The Kitchen Sink" in reference to Bratby's picture. Sylvester argued that there was a new interest among young painters in domestic scenes, with stress on the banality of life. </p>
<p>Bratby painted several kitchen subjects, often turning practical utensils such as sieves and spoons into semi-abstract shapes. He also painted bathrooms and made three paintings of toilets. Other artists associated with the kitchen sink style include Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith. The term was applied to a then-emerging style of drama, which favoured a more realistic representation of working class life, and it was adopted in the United States to refer to the live television dramas of the 1950s by Paddy Chayefsky and others. </p>
<p>Before the 1950s, the United Kingdom's working class were often depicted stereotypically in Noel Coward's drawing room comedies and British films. It was also seen as being in opposition to the "well-made play", the kind which theatre critic Kenneth Tynan once denounced as being set in "Loamshire", of dramatists like Terence Rattigan. Kitchen sink works were created with the intention of changing all that. Their political views were initially labelled as radical, sometimes even anarchic.</p>
<p>John Osborne's play 'Look Back In Anger' (1956) showed 'Angry Young Men' not totally dissimilar to the film and theatre directors of the movement; the hero is a graduate, but working in a manual occupation. It dealt with social alienation, the claustrophobia and frustrations of a provincial life on low incomes.</p>
<p>The impact of this work inspired Arnold Wesker and Shelagh Delaney, among numerous others, to write plays of their own. The English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, headed by George Devine, and Theatre Workshop organised by Joan Littlewood were particularly prominent in bringing these plays to the public's attention. Critic John Heilpern wrote that 'Look Back in Anger' expressed such "immensity of feeling and class hatred" that it altered the course of English theatre. The term "Angry theatre" was coined by critic John Russell Taylor. </p>
<p>This was all part of the British New Wave - a transposition of the concurrent nouvelle vague film movement in France, some of whose works, such as 'The 400 Blows' of 1959, also emphasized the lives of the urban proletariat. British filmmakers such as Tony Richardson and Lindsay Anderson channelled their vitriolic anger into film making. Confrontational films such as 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' (1960) and 'A Taste of Honey' (1962) were noteworthy films in the genre.</p>
<p>Later, as many of these writers and directors diversified, kitchen sink realism was taken up by television. The single play was then a staple of the medium, and 'Armchair Theatre' (1956-68), produced by the ITV contractor ABC, 'The Wednesday Play' (1964-70) and 'Play for Today' (1970-84), both BBC series, contained many works of this kind. Jeremy Sandford's television play 'Cathy Come Home' (1966, directed by Ken Loach for The Wednesday Play slot) for instance, addressed the then-stigmatized issue of homelessness.</p>
<p>Kitchen sink realism was also seen as apparent in the novels of Stan Barstow, John Braine, Alan Sillitoe and others.</p>

			<h1>Melodrama</h1>
<p>The term melodrama refers to a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions. </p>
<p>It may also refer to the genre which includes such works, or to language, behavior, or events which resemble them. </p>
<p>It is usually based around having the same character traits, for example a hero (always the fearless one), heroine (the love of the hero, usually the one that the hero saves), villain (usually likes the heroine too) and villain's sidekick (typically gets in the way of or annoys the villain).</p>
<p>It is also used in scholarly and historical musical contexts to refer to dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. </p>
<p>The term originated from the early 19th-century French word melodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drama, which in turn derives from Greek dran, to do, perform). An alternative English spelling, now obsolete, is "melodrame".</p>
<p>Beginning in the 18th century, melodrama was a technique of combining spoken recitation with short pieces of accompanying music. In such works, music and spoken dialogue typically alternated, although the music was sometimes also used to accompany pantomime. The earliest known examples are scenes in J. E. Eberlin's Latin school play 'Sigismundus' (1753). The first full melodrama was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's 'Pygmalion', the text of which was written in 1762 but was first staged in Lyon in 1770. The overture and an Andante were composed by Rousseau, but the bulk of the music was composed by Horace Coignet. A different musical setting of Rousseau's 'Pygmalion' by Anton Schweitzer was performed in Weimar in 1772, and Goethe wrote of it approvingly in 'Dichtung und Wahrheit'. 'Pygmalion' is a monodrama, written for one actor. Some 30 other monodramas were produced in Germany in the fourth quarter of the 18th century. </p>
<p>When two actors are involved the term duodrama may be used. George Benda was particularly successful with his duodramas 'Ariadne auf Naxos' (1775) and 'Medea' (1778). The sensational success of Benda's melodramas led Mozart to use two long melodramatic monologues in his opera 'Zaide' (1780). Other later, and better-known examples of the melodramatic style in operas are the grave-digging scene in Beethoven's 'Fidelio' (1805) and the incantation scene in Weber's 'Der Freischutz' (1821).</p>
<p>A few operettas exhibit melodrama in the sense of music played under spoken dialogue, for instance, Gilbert and Sullivan's 'Ruddigore' (itself a parody of melodramas in the modern sense) has a short "melodrame" (reduced to dialogue alone in many productions) in the second act; Jacques Offenbach's 'Orpheus in the Underworld' opens with a melodrama delivered by the character of "Public Opinion"; and other pieces from operetta and musicals may be considered melodramas, such as the "Recit and Minuet" in Gilbert and Sullivan's 'The Sorcerer'</p>
<p>As an example from the American musical, several long speeches in Lerner and Loewe's Brigadoon are delivered over an accompaniment of evocative music. The technique is also frequently used in Spanish zarzuela, both in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continued also to be used as a "special effect" in opera, for instance Richard Strauss's 'Die Frau ohne Schatten.'</p>
<p>In a similar manner, Victorians often added "incidental music" under the dialogue to a pre-existing play, although this style of composition was already practiced in the days of Ludwig van Beethoven ('Egmont') and Franz Schubert ('Rosamunde'). This type of often-lavish production is now mostly limited to film due to the cost of hiring an orchestra. </p>
<p>In Paris, the 19th century saw a flourishing of melodrama in the many theatres that were located on the popular Boulevard du Crime, especially in the Gaﵥ. All this was to come to an end, however, when most of these theatres were demolished during the rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann in 1862. </p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, the term melodrama had nearly exclusively narrowed down to a specific genre of salon entertainment: more or less rhythmically spoken words (often poetry) not sung, sometimes more or less enacted, at least with some dramatic structure or plot synchronized to an accompaniment of music (usually piano). It was looked down on as a genre for authors and composers of lesser stature (probably also the reason why virtually no realisations of the genre are still remembered).</p>
<p>The Victorian stage melodrama featured six stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent, a sidekick and a servant of the aged parent engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil.</p>
<p>English melodrama evolved from the tradition of populist drama established during the Middle Ages by mystery and morality plays, under influences from Italian commedia dell'arte as well as German Sturm und Drang drama and Parisian melodrama of the post-Revolutionary period. </p>
<p>A notable French melodramatist was Pixerecourt whose La Femme a deux maris was wildly popular with the masses. </p>
<p>The first English play to be called a melodrama or 'melodrame' was 'A Tale of Mystery' (1802) by Thomas Holcroft. This was an example of the Gothic genre, a previous theatrical example of which was 'The Castle Spectre' (1797) by Matthew Gregory Lewis. Other Gothic melodramas include 'The Miller and his Men' (1813) by Isaac Pocock, 'The Woodsman's Hut' (1814) by Samuel Arnold and 'The Broken Sword' (1816) by William Dimond.</p>
<p>Supplanting the Gothic, the next popular sub-genre was the nautical melodrama, pioneered by Douglas Jerrold in his 'Black-Eyed Susan' (1829). Other nautical melodramas included Jerrold's 'The Mutiny at the Nore' (1830) and 'The Red Rover' (1829) by Edward Fitzball (Rowell 1953).</p>
<p>Melodramas based on urban situations became popular in the mid-nineteenth century. These include 'The Streets of London' (1864) by Dion Boucicault; and 'Lost in London' (1867) by Watts Phillips.</p>
<p>The sensation novels of the 1860s and 1870s were fertile material for melodramatic adaptations. A notable example of this genre is 'Lady Audley's Secret' by Elizabeth Braddon adapted, in two different versions, by George Roberts and C.H. Hazlewood.</p>
<p>The villain was always the central character in melodrama and crime was a favourite theme. This included dramatisations of the murderous careers of Burke and Hare, Sweeney Todd (first featured in 'The String of Pearls' (1847) by George Dibdin Pitt), the murder of 'Maria Marten in the Red Barn' and the bizarre exploits of Spring Heeled Jack. </p>

			<h1>Mime</h1>
<p>A mime artist  is someone who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a performance art, involving miming, or the acting out a story through body motions, without use of speech. In earlier times, in English, such a performer would typically be referred to as a mummer. Miming is to be distinguished from silent comedy, in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch.</p>
<p>The performance of pantomime originates at its earliest in Ancient Greece; the name is taken from a single masked dancer called Pantomimus, although performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime such as mummer plays and later dumbshows evolved. In early nineteenth century Paris, Jean-Gaspard Deburau solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times-the silent figure in whiteface.</p>
<p>Jacques Copeau, strongly influenced by Commedia dell'arte and Japanese Noh theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. etienne Decroux, a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and developed corporeal mime into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of naturalism. Jacques Lecoq contributed significantly to the development of mime and physical theatre with his training methods.</p>
<p>Prior to the work of etienne Decroux there was no major treatise on the art of mime, and so any recreation of mime as performed prior to the twentieth century is largely conjecture, based on interpretation of diverse sources. However, the twentieth century also brought a new medium into widespread usage: the motion picture.</p>
<p>The restrictions of early motion picture technology meant that stories had to be told with minimal dialogue, which was largely restricted to inter-titles. This often demanded a highly stylized form of physical acting largely derived from the stage. Thus, mime played an important role in films prior to advent of talkies (films with sound or speech). The mimetic style of film acting was used to great effect in German Expressionist film.</p>
<p>Silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton learned the craft of mime in the theatre, but through film, they would have a profound influence on mimes working in live theatre even decades after their death. Indeed, Chaplin may be the most well-documented mime in history.</p>
<p>The famous French comedian, writer and director Jacques Tati achieved his initial popularity working as a mime, and indeed his later films had only minimal dialogue, relying instead on many subtle expertly choreographed visual gags. Tati, like Chaplin before him, would mime out the movements of every single character in his films and ask his actors to repeat them.</p>
<p>Mime has been performed onstage, with Marcel Marceau and his character "Bip" being the most famous. </p>
<p>Mime is also a popular art form in street theatre and busking. Traditionally, these sorts of performances involve the actor/actress wearing tight black and white clothing with white facial makeup. However, contemporary mimes often perform without whiteface. </p>
<p>Similarly, while traditional mimes have been completely silent, contemporary mimes, while refraining from speaking, sometimes employ vocal sounds when they perform. </p>
<p>Mime acts are often comical, but some can be very serious.</p>
<p>The first recorded pantomime actor was Telestes in the play 'Seven Against Thebes' by Aeschylus. Tragic pantomime was developed by Pulades of Kilikia; comic pantomime was developed by Bathullos of Alexandria. </p>
<p>The Roman emperor Trajan banished pantomimists; Caligula favoured them; Marcus Aurelius made them priests of Apollo. Nero himself acted as a mime</p>
<p>Classical Indian musical theatre, although often erroneously labelled a "dance," is a group of theatrical forms in which the performer presents a narrative via stylized gesture, an array of hand positions, and mime illusions to play different characters, actions, and landscapes. Recitation, music, and even percussive footwork sometimes accompany the performance. The Natya Shastra, an ancient treatise on theatre by Bharata Muni, mentions silent performance, or mukabhinaya.</p>
<p>In Kathakali, stories from Indian epics are told with facial expressions, hand signals and body motions. Performances are accompanied by songs narrating the story while the actors act out the scene, followed by actor detailing without background support of narrative song.</p>
<p>The Japanese Noh tradition has greatly influenced many contemporary mime and theatre practitioners including Jacques Copeau and Jacques Lecoq because of its use of mask work and highly physical performance style.</p>
<p>Butoh, though often referred to as a dance form, has been adopted by various theatre practitioners as well.</p>

			<h1>Mockumentary</h1>
<p>A mockumentary (a portmanteau of the words mock and documentary), is a type of film or television show in which fictional events are presented in documentary format. </p>
<p>These productions are often used to analyse or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself. </p>
<p>They may be either comedic or dramatic in form, although comedic mockumentaries are more common. A dramatic mockumentary (sometimes referred to as docufiction) should not be confused with docudrama, a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events.</p>
<p>Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries, with B roll and talking heads discussing past events, or as cinema verite pieces following people as they go through various events. Though the precise origins of the genre are not known, examples emerged during the 1950s, when archival film footage became relatively easy to locate. </p>
<p>A very early example was a short piece on the "Swiss Spaghetti Harvest" that appeared as an April fools' joke on the British television program Panorama in 1957.</p>
<p>The term "mockumentary" is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1980s when 'This Is Spinal Tap' director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film. </p>
<p>It is not known with certainty when the term "mock-documentary" was first used, but the Oxford English Dictionary notes appearances of "mockumentary" from 1965. </p>
<p>Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised, as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretence of reality. Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks, also to sustain the atmosphere, although there are exceptions - for example, 'Operation Good Guys' had a laugh track from its second series onwards.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, the mockumentary format has enjoyed much attention, especially in the directorial work of Spinal Tap star Christopher Guest. Films such as 'Best in Show,' 'Waiting for Guffman', and 'A Mighty Wind', penned by Guest and co-star Eugene Levy, were critical successes.</p>
<p>'Zelig' was a 1983 American mockumentary film written and directed by Woody Allen, and starring Allen and Mia Farrow. Allen plays 'Zelig', a curiously nondescript enigma who is discovered for his remarkable ability to transform himself to resemble anyone he's near.</p>
<p>The 1983 Comic Strip Presents... film 'Bad News Tour' was a spoof rockumentary about a British heavy metal band. It preceded Spinal Tap by a year, but is not known to have been an influence on the U.S. film. The film led to LPs being released and the band really touring and was followed by a sequel, 'More Bad News' in 1987. 'Stella Street' was a mockumentary which ran on the BBC from 1997 to 2001. It was written by Phil Cornwell, John Sessions and Peter Richardson and featured Cornwell and Sessions playing all the characters between them. The series was shot on handheld camcorders. </p>
<p>In television, the most notable mockumentaries in the 2000s have been: ABC Australia's 'The Games' (1998-2000), 'Trailer Park Boys' (2001-2008), the British shows 'Marion and Geoff' (2000), 'Twenty Twelve' (2011-2012) (which follows the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission in the run up to the London 2012 Olympic Games), 'The Office' (2001) and its many international offshoots, 'Come Fly with Me' (2010), which follows the activity at a fictional airport and its variety of staff and passengers. British comedy duo Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French often presented short mockumentaries as extended sketches in their TV show French &amp; Saunders.</p>

			<h1>Mummers Plays</h1>
<p>Mummers Plays (also known as mumming) are seasonal folk plays performed by troupes of actors known as mummers or guisers (or by local names such as rhymers, pace-eggers, soulers, tipteerers, galoshins, guysers, and so on), originally from England (see wren boys), but later in other parts of the world. </p>
<p>They are sometimes performed in the street but more usually as house-to-house visits and in public houses.</p>
<p>Although the term mummers has been used since medieval times, no play scripts or performance details survive from that era, and the term may have been used loosely to describe performers of several different kinds. </p>
<p>Mumming may have precedents in German and French carnival customs, with rare but close parallels also in late medieval England.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of mummers' plays as they are known today (usually involving a magical cure by a quack doctor) is from the mid to late 18th century. </p>
<p>Mumming plays should not be confused with the earlier mystery plays.</p>
<p>Mummers' and guisers' plays were formerly performed throughout most of English-speaking Ireland, Europe and Great Britain, as well as in other English-speaking parts of the world including Newfoundland, Kentucky and Saint Kitts and Nevis. In England, there are a few surviving traditional teams, but there have been many revivals of mumming, often associated nowadays with Morris and sword dance groups.</p>
<p>Mummers and "guisers" (performers in disguise) can be traced back at least to the Middle Ages, though when the term "mummer" appears in medieval manuscripts it is rarely clear what sort of performance was involved. A key element was visiting people in disguise at Christmas. </p>
<p>Although usually broadly comic performances, the plays seem to be based on underlying themes of duality and resurrection and generally involve a battle between two or more characters, perhaps representing good against evil. </p>
<p>Usually they feature a doctor who has a magic potion which is able to resuscitate a slain character. </p>
<p>In mummers' plays, the central incident is the killing and restoring to life of one of the characters. </p>
<p>The characters may be introduced in a series of short speeches (usually in rhyming couplets) in which each personage has his own introductory announcement, or they may introduce themselves in the course of the play's action. </p>
<p>The principal characters, presented in a wide variety of manner and style, are a Hero, his chief opponent, the Fool, and a quack Doctor; the defining feature of mumming plays is the Doctor, and the main purpose of the fight is to provide him with a patient to cure. </p>
<p>The hero sometimes kills and sometimes is killed by his opponent; in either case, the Doctor comes to restore the dead man to life.</p>
<p>The name of the hero in the English tradition is most commonly Saint George, King George, or Prince George. His principal opponents are the Turkish Knight (in southern England), or a valiant soldier named Slasher (elsewhere). </p>
<p>Other characters include: Old Father Christmas (who introduces some plays), Beelzebub, Little Devil Doubt (who demands money from the audience), Robin Hood (an alternative hero in the Cotswolds), Galoshin (a hero in Scotland)</p>
<p>Despite the frequent presence of Saint George, the Dragon rarely appears in these plays, though it is often mentioned.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the performers will wear face-obscuring hats or other kinds of headgear, which create the impression of being masked. </p>
<p>Some mummers' faces are blackened or painted red by way of disguise. Many mummers and guisers, however, have no facial disguise at all.</p>
<p>Mumming, at any rate in the South of England, had its heyday at the end of the 19th century and the earliest years of the 20th century. Most traditional mummers groups (known as "sides") stopped with the onset of the first World War. To most groups, mumming was a way of raising extra money for Christmas and the play was taken round the big houses. Most Southern English versions end with the entrance of "Little Johnny Jack his wife and family on his back". Johnny, traditionally played by the youngest mummer in the group, first asks for food and then more urgently for money. Johnny Jack's wife and family were either dolls in a model house or sometimes a picture.</p>
<p>Those involved with mumming groups were often unwilling to admit to it as they did not like to confess to begging. However it seems that it could be quite lucrative, it is said that three nights of mumming often raised as much as a whole month's wages for the agricultural labourers who mostly made up the groups.</p>
<p>Some groups continued after the first World War and even beyond the second, but most did not. The groups were normally based in a village and each village had a slightly different version of the play. </p>
<p>In the second half of the twentieth century many groups were revived, mostly by folk music and dance enthusiasts. The revived plays are frequently taken around inns and public houses around Christmas time and the begging done for some charity rather than for the mummers themselves.</p>

			<h1>Murder Mystery</h1>
<p>While the archetype for a murder mystery dates back to "The Three Apples" in the 'One Thousand and One Nights', crime fiction began to be considered as a serious genre only around 1900. </p>
<p>The earliest known crime novel is "The Rector of Veilbye" by the Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, published in 1829. Better known are the earlier dark works of Edgar Allan Poe (e.g., 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue ' (1841), "'The Mystery of Marie Roget ' (1842), and 'The Purloined Letter' (1844). Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel 'The Woman in White' was published in 1860, while 'The Moonstone' (1868) is often thought to be his masterpiece.</p>
<p>The whodunit: The most common form of detective fiction. It features a complex, plot-driven story in which the reader is provided with clues from which the identity of the perpetrator of the crime may be deduced before the solution is revealed at the end of the book.</p>
<p>In the theatre, many well know novels have been adapted for the stage and film, for example Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho (1991) and books by Agatha Christie and Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
<p>Another more recent variation of the murder mystery is as an evening dinner event.</p>
<p>Murder mystery companies are booked for private functions/ venues or run events themselves in historical old buildings.</p>
<p>They can take place over the course of one evening or as a weekend event.</p>
<p>The performers follow a loose plot and improvise a story around the guests.</p>
<p>Sometimes this involves moving from room to room like in promenade theatre.</p>
<p>There is a lot of slapstick comedy and elements of farce/ use of innuendo.</p>
<p>The style of acting is very over the top.</p>

			<h1>Naturalism &amp; Realism</h1>
<p>Naturalism is a movement in European drama and theatre that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create a perfect illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies: detailed, three-dimensional settings (which bring Darwinian understandings of the determining role of the environment into the staging of human drama); everyday speech forms (prose over poetry); a secular world-view (no ghosts, spirits or gods intervening in the human action); an exclusive focus on subjects that are contemporary and indigenous (no exotic, otherworldly or fantastic locales, nor historical or mythic time-periods); an extension of the social range of characters portrayed (away from the aristocrats of classical drama, towards bourgeois and eventually working-class protagonists); and a style of acting that attempts to recreate the impression of reality (often by seeking complete identification with the role, understood in terms of its 'given circumstances', which, again, transcribe Darwinian motifs into performance, as advocated by Stanislavski). </p>
<p>Naturalistic role play is used within theatrical performances to demonstrate to the audience or show the audience how this would appear in real life. No still images are used as this does not show the full quality of the piece of drama. </p>
<p>Naturalistic drama is used within many drama pieces to show the true feelings of the characters, this helps the characters to touch the audience with their feelings properly and appropriately.</p>
<p>Naturalism was first advocated explicitly by emile Zola in his 1881 essay entitled 'Naturalism in the Theatre'.</p>
<p>Naturalistic writers were influenced by the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin. They believed that one's heredity and social environment determine one's character. Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine "scientifically" the underlying forces (i.e. the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. </p>
<p>Naturalistic works are opposed to romanticism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic, or even supernatural treatment. They often include uncouth or sordid subject matter; for example, emile Zola's works had a frankness about sexuality along with a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works exposed the dark harshness of life, including poverty, racism, sex, prejudice, disease, prostitution, and filth. As a result, Naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for being too blunt.</p>
<p>Naturalism was criticized in the twentieth century by a whole host of theatre practitioners; Constantin Stanislavski, for example, argued for a puncturing of the illusion of the surface of reality in order to reach the real forces that determine it beneath its appearance; in place of the absorption within a fiction that Naturalistic performance promotes in its audience, he attempted to inculcate a more detached consideration of the realities and the issues behind them that the play confronts. His approach is a development, however, of the critical project initiated by Naturalism; it is a form of modernist realism. </p>
<p>Naturalistic performance is often unsuitable for the performance of other types of theatre-particularly older forms, but also many twentieth-century non-Naturalistic plays. Shakespearean verse, for example, demands a rigorous attention to its rhythmic sub-structure and often long and complex phrasings; naturalistic actors tend to cut these down to the far shorter speech patterns of modern drama, destroying the rhythmic support that assists the audience's process of comprehension. In addition, Shakespearean drama assumed a natural, direct and often-renewed contact with the audience on the part of the performer; 'fourth wall' performances foreclose these complex layering of theatrical and dramatic realities the game that are built into Shakespeare's dramaturgy. A good example is the line spoken by Cleopatra in 'Antony and Cleopatra' act five, when she contemplates her humiliation in Rome at the hands of Octavius Caesar, by means of mocking theatrical renditions of her fate: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore"; that this was to be spoken by a boy in a dress in a theatre is an integral part of its dramatic meaning-a complexity unavailable to a purely naturalistic treatment.</p>
<p>Realism was a general movement in 19th-century theatre that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances.</p>
<p>Russia's first professional playwright, Aleksey Pisemsky, who was a step brother the famous Jack Boutier, (whose 'A Bitter Fate' (1859) anticipated Naturalism), and Leo Tolstoy (whose 'The Power of Darkness' (1886) is "one of the most effective of naturalistic plays"), a tradition of psychological realism in Russia culminated with the establishment of the Moscow Art Theatre by Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Their ground-breaking productions of the plays of Anton Chekhov in turn influenced Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. </p>
<p>Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of actor training that is particularly suited to psychological realism.</p>
<p>19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential." </p>
<p>In opera, verismo refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought incorporate the naturalism of emile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic - sometimes sordid or violent - depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes.</p>

			<h1>Musical Theatre</h1>
<p>Musical theatre is a form of theatre that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of the piece - humour, pathos, love, anger - are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. </p>
<p>Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements of the works. </p>
<p>Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.</p>
<p>Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, culminating with the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like 'Of Thee I Sing' (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as 'Show Boat' (1927) and 'Oklahoma!' (1943). Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include 'West Side Story' (1957), 'The Fantasticks' (1960), 'Hair' (1967), 'A Chorus Line' (1975), 'Les Miserables' (1985), 'The Phantom of the Opera' (1986),'Rent' (1994), 'The Producers' (2001) and 'Wicked' (2003).</p>
<p>Musicals are performed all around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big budget West End and Broadway theatre productions in London and New York, or in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, on tour, or by amateur groups in schools, theatres and other performance spaces. In addition to Britain and North America, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in many countries in Europe, Latin America, Australasia and Asia.</p>
<p>Since the 20th century, the "book musical" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. </p>
<p>The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. </p>
<p>The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for "little book"). </p>
<p>The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical but the interpretation of a musical by its creative team heavily influences the way in which a musical is presented. That team includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. </p>
<p>A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. </p>
<p>Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in 'Chicago.'</p>
<p>There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. </p>
<p>Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music, and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. </p>
<p>A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although "sung dialogue" or recitative may be used, especially in so-called "sung-through" musicals such as 'Jesus Christ Superstar', 'Les Miserables', and 'Evita'. </p>
<p>Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.</p>
<p>Moments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, "when the emotion becomes too strong for speech you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance." In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story. </p>
<p>Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue therefore there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.</p>
<p>The material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels ('Wicked' and 'Man of La Mancha'), plays ('Hello, Dolly!'), classic legends ('Camelot'), historical events ('Evita') or films ('The Producers' and 'Hairspray'). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for musical films, such as 'The Sound of Music', 'West Side Story', 'My Fair Lady', and 'Chicago'.</p>
<p>There are various Eastern traditions of theatre that include music, such as Chinese Opera, Taiwanese opera, Noh and Musical theatre in India, including Sanskrit drama, Classical Indian dance and Yakshagana. India has, since the 20th century, produced numerous musical films, referred to as "Bollywood" musicals, and in Japan a series of musicals based on popular Anime and Manga comics has developed in recent decades. </p>
<p>Musical theatre in Europe dates back to the theatre of ancient Greece where music and dance was included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE. The dramatists Aeschylus and Sophocles composed their own music to accompany their plays and choreographed the dances of the chorus. The 3rd-century BCE Roman comedies of Plautus included song and dance routines performed with orchestrations. The Romans also introduced technical innovations. For example, to make the dance steps more audible in large open air theatres, Roman actors attached metal chips called "sabilla" to their stage footwear - the first tap shoes. By the Middle Ages, theatre in Europe consisted mostly of travelling minstrels and small performing troupes of performers singing and offering slapstick comedy. In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas, such as 'The Play of Herod' and 'The Play of Daniel' taught the liturgy, set to church chants. Later "mystery plays" were created that told a biblical story in a sequence of entertaining parts. Several pageant wagons (stages on wheels) would move about the city, and a group of actors would tell their part of the story. Once finished, the group would move on with their wagon, and the next group would arrive to tell its part of the story. These plays developed into an autonomous form of musical theatre, with poetic forms sometimes alternating with the prose dialogues and liturgical chants. The poetry was provided with modified or completely new melodies</p>
<p>The European Renaissance saw older forms evolve into commedia dell'arte, an Italian tradition where raucous clowns improvised their way through familiar stories, and from there, opera buffa. In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music, with performances on organs, lutes, viols and pipes for up to an hour before and during the performance. Plays, perhaps particularly the heavier histories and tragedies, were frequently broken up with a short musical play, perhaps derived from the Italian intermezzo, with music, jokes and dancing, or were followed by an afterpiece known as a jig, often consisting of scandalous or libellous dialogue set to popular tunes (anticipating the Ballad Opera). Court masques also developed during the Tudor period that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex stage design, sometimes by a renowned architect such as Inigo Jones, presented a deferential allegory flattering to a noble or royal patron. Ben Jonson wrote many masques, often collaborating with Jones. William Shakespeare often included masque-like sections in many of his plays. </p>
<p>After the death of Charles II in 1685, English opera began to fall out of fashion. </p>
<p>By the 18th century, two forms of musical theatre were popular in Britain: ballad operas, like John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera' (1728), that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and comic operas, with original scores and mostly romantic plot lines, like Michael Balfe's 'The Bohemian Girl' (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, singspiel, comedie en vaudeville, opera comique and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. Other musical theatre forms developed by the 19th century, such as music hall, melodrama, burlesque and vaudeville. Melodramas and burlettas, in particular, were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music. </p>
<p>The first recorded long-running play of any kind was 'The Beggar's Opera,' which ran for 62 successive performances in 1728. </p>
<p>By the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan. Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate prices, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's first "long-run" musical was a 50 performance hit called 'The Elves' in 1857. </p>
<p>Gilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to "integrate" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue were designed to advance a coherent story. Their works were admired and copied by early authors and composers of musicals such as Ivan Caryll, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart, Alan Jay Lerner, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Other British composers of the 1870s and 1880s included Edward Solomon and F. Osmond Carr. The most popular British shows, beginning with the Savoy operas, also enjoyed profitable New York productions and tours of Britain, America, Europe, Australasia and South Africa. These shows were fare for "respectable" audiences, a marked contrast from the risque burlesques, melodramas, minstrel shows, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that dominated the stage prior to Gilbert and Sullivan and drew a sometimes seedy crowd looking for less wholesome entertainment.</p>
<p>In English-speaking countries, during World War I, German-language operetta lost its popularity. The theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of World War I, and they flocked to the theatre. </p>
<p>The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged. </p>
<p>The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs, at the expanse of plot. Typical of the decade were light-hearted productions like  'Funny Face'. While the books of these shows may have been forgettable, they featured stars such as Marilyn Miller and Fred Astaire and produced dozens of enduring popular songs ("standards") by, most notably, Jerome Kern, the Gershwin brothers, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Vincent Youmans, and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, popular music was dominated by musical theatre composers and lyricists. These musicals and the standards they produced, including "Fascinating Rhythm", "Tea for Two", and "Someone to Watch Over Me", became popular on both sides of the Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>Many shows were revues, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual Ziegfeld Follies, spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes, and beautiful chorus girls. In London, stars such as Ivor Novello were popular. These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive. Meanwhile, operettas, which had been nearly absent from the English-speaking stage since World War I, regained popularity; works by continental European composers were successful, as were those by Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml in America, which included 'Rose-Marie' and 'The Student Prince' respectively.</p>
<p>Progressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, 'Show Boat', which premiered on December 27, 1927 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York, represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. Nevertheless, as the Great Depression set in during the post-Broadway national tour of Show Boat, the public turned back to light, brassy, escapist entertainment, and no follow-up was produced so seriously treating serious social themes until 'Oklahoma!' </p>
<p>The Great Depression affected theatre audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as people had little money to spend on entertainment. Only a few stage shows exceeded a run on Broadway or in London of 500 performances during the decade.</p>
<p>The golden age of musicals was the 1940's and 50's. Works by Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Weill and Gershwin, Rogers and Hammerstein, Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim were huge.</p>
<p>The 1960's produced some blockbusters such as 'Funny Girl', 'Hello Dolly' and 'Cabaret'.</p>
<p>The 1970's saw the emergence of the rock musical, 'Jesus Christ Superstar', 'Godspell', 'The Rocky Horror Show'. Some began as concept albums e.g. 'Tommy'. The 70's also produced musicals that dealt with social themes and issues.</p>
<p>The 1980's saw the influence of European mega- musicals, that had high tech SFX e.g. a helicopter landing in 'Miss Saigon'.</p>
<p>The 1990's saw the influence of large corporations such as Disney, producing 'The Lion King', 'Beauty and the Beast' with the music being written by Elton John.</p>

			<h1>Old Time Music Hall</h1>
<p>Music hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment which was popular between 1850 and 1960. It involved a mixture of popular song, comedy, speciality acts and variety entertainment. </p>
<p>The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. </p>
<p>British music hall was similar to American vaudeville, featuring rousing songs and comic acts, while in the United Kingdom the term vaudeville referred to more working-class types of entertainment that would have been termed burlesque in America.</p>
<p>With its origins being found in saloon bars within public houses during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences, so much so, that during the 1850s, the public houses were demolished and music hall theatres were developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place. This differed somewhat from the conventional type of theatre which, up until then, seated the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room. </p>
<p>Early music halls included Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth and The Middlesex, in Drury Lane, otherwise known as the 'Old Mo'.</p>
<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, the halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs. As a result, professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers including, more notably Marie Lloyd, Dan Leno, Little Titch and George Leybourne. </p>
<p>Music hall did not adopt its own unique style. Instead all forms of entertainment were performed: male and female impersonators, Lions Comiques, mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists such as John Orlando Parry and George Grossmith were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.</p>
<p>By the twentieth century, music hall was on the decline, made worse in 1907 by a dispute between artists, stage hands and managers, which inevitably ended in a strike. </p>
<p>The halls recovered by the start of World War I and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but was becoming less popular due to upcoming Jazz, Swing, and Big Band dance music acts. </p>
<p>Licensing restrictions had also changed with drinking being banned from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. Deemed old fashioned and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and the modern day variety began.</p>
<p>The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a greater price at the bar, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed. The most famous London saloon of the early days was the Grecian Saloon, established in 1825, at The Eagle (a former tea-garden), 2 Shepherdess Walk, off the City Road in north London.  Later known as the Grecian Theatre, it was here that Marie Lloyd made her debut at the age of 14 in 1884. It is still famous because of an English nursery rhyme, with the somewhat mysterious lyrics:</p>
<p>Up and down the City Road, In and out The Eagle, That's the way the money goes, Pop goes the weasel.</p>
<p>The establishment often regarded as the first true music hall was the Canterbury, 143 Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth built by Charles Morton, afterwards dubbed "the Father of the Halls", on the site of a skittle alley next to his pub, the Canterbury Tavern. It opened on 17 May 1852: described as "the most significant date in all the history of music hall". The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms, but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size. It was further extended in 1859, later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by bombing in 1942.</p>
<p>A noted music hall entrepreneur of this time was Carlo Gatti who built a music hall, known as Gatti's, at Hungerford Market in 1857. He sold the music hall to South Eastern Railway in 1862, and the site became Charing Cross railway station. With the proceeds from selling his first music hall, Gatti acquired a restaurant in Westminster Bridge Road, opposite The Canterbury music hall. He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti's music hall, known as "Gatti's-in-the-Road", in 1865. It later became a cinema. The building was badly damaged in the Second World War, and was demolished in 1950. In 1867, he acquired a public house in Villiers Street named "The Arches", under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station. He opened it as another music hall, known as "Gatti's-in-The-Arches". After his death his family continued to operate the music hall, known for a period as the Hungerford or Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties. It became a cinema in 1910, and the Players' Theatre in 1946. </p>
<p>By 1865 there were thirty-two music halls in London seating between 500 to 5,000 people plus an unknown, but large, number of smaller venues. In 1878 numbers peaked, with seventy-eight large music halls in the metropolis and 300 smaller venues. Thereafter numbers declined due to stricter licensing restrictions imposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and LCC, and because of commercial competition between popular large suburban halls and the smaller venues, which put the latter out of business.</p>
<p>One of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the Empire, Leicester Square, built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall license in 1887. Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans. </p>
<p>Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the Strand built 1888-90 in an eclectic neo-Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish-Indian embellishments. "The Tivoli" became a brand name for music-halls all over the British Empire. During 1892, the Royal English Opera House, which had been a financial failure in Shaftesbury Avenue, applied for a music hall license and was converted by Walter Emden into a grand music hall and renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties, managed by Charles Morton. Denied by the newly created LCC permission to construct the promenade, which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra, the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in tableau vivants, though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh toned body stockings and were not naked at all.  </p>
<p>As Music Hall grew in popularity and respectability, and as the licensing authorities exercised ever firmer regulation, the original arrangement of a large hall with tables at which drink was served, changed to that of a drink-free auditorium. The acceptance of Music Hall as a legitimate cultural form was established by the first Royal Variety Performance before King George V during 1912 at the Palace Theatre. However, consistent with this new respectability the best-known music hall entertainer of the time, Marie Lloyd, was not invited, being deemed too 'saucy' for presentation to the monarchy.</p>
<p>The development of syndicates controlling a number of theatres, such as the Stoll circuit, increased tensions between employees and employers. On 22 January 1907, a dispute between artists, stage hands and managers of the Holborn Empire worsened. Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed, organised by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The strike lasted for almost two weeks and was known as the Music Hall War. It became extremely well known, and was advocated enthusiastically by the main spokesmen of the trade union and Labour movement -Ben Tillett and Keir Hardie for example. Picket lines were organized outside the theatres by the artistes, while in the provinces theatre management attempted to oblige artistes to sign a document promising never to join a trade union. The strike ended in arbitration, which satisfied most of the main demands, including a minimum wage and maximum working week. The pressure for greater rewards for music hall songwriters resulted in the application of copyright law to musical compositions. This in turn increased the profitability of the music publication industry, and the sale of music in printed form. </p>
<p>The term "Tin Pan Alley" for the music publication industry gained currency from the practice of rival publishers of banging together pots and pans in order to disrupt their competitors' musical auditions. The music publishers at the time (Feldman, Francis and Day...) were large, extremely profitable companies. They sold the right to sing songs to particular artists, and no other person had the right to sing the songs in public. </p>
<p>World War I may have been the high-water-mark of music hall popularity. The artists and composers threw themselves into rallying public support and enthusiasm for the war effort. Patriotic music hall compositions like 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' (1914), 'Pack up Your Troubles' (1915), 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary' (1914) and 'We Don't Want to Lose You (but we think you ought to Go'), were sung by music hall audiences, and sometimes by soldiers in the trenches. </p>
<p>Many songs promoted recruitment ('All the boys in khaki get the nice girls', 1915); others satirised particular elements of the war experience. 'What did you do in the Great war, Daddy' (1919) criticised profiteers and slackers; Vesta Tilley's 'I've got a bit of a blighty one' (1916) showed a soldier delighted to have a wound just serious enough to be sent home. The rhymes give a sense of grim humour (When they wipe my face with sponges/ and they feed me on blancmanges/ I'm glad I've got a bit of a blighty one). </p>
<p>Tilley became more popular than ever during this time, when she and her husband, Walter de Frece, managed a military recruitment drive. In the guise of characters like Tommy in the Trench and Jack Tar Home from Sea, Tilley performed songs like 'The Army of today's All Right' and 'Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier'. This is how she got the nickname Britain's best recruiting sergeant - young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show. She also performed in hospitals and sold War Bonds. Her husband was knighted in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, with Tilley becoming Lady de Frece. </p>
<p>Possibly the most notorious of music hall songs from the First World War was 'Oh! It's a Lovely War' (1917), popularised by male impersonator Ella Shields.</p>
<p>Music hall songs needed to gain and hold the attention of an often jaded and unruly urban audience. </p>
<p>Typically a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone, and a repeated chorus which carries the principal melody, and in which the audience is encouraged to join.</p>
<p>In Britain, the first music hall songs often promoted the alcoholic wares of the owners of the halls in which they were performed. Songs like 'Glorious Beer', and the first major music hall success, 'Champagne Charlie' (1867) had a major influence in establishing the new art form. The tune of 'Champagne Charlie' became used for the Salvation Army hymn 'Bless His Name, He Sets Me Free' (1881). When asked why the tune should be used like this, William Booth is said to have replied, "Why should the devil have all the good tunes?". The people the Army sought to save, knew nothing of the hymn tunes or gospel melodies used in the churches, but "the music hall had been their melody school".</p>
<p>By the 1870s the songs were free of their folk music origins, and particular songs also started to become associated with particular singers, often with exclusive contracts with the songwriter, just as many pop songs are today. </p>
<p>Towards the end of the style the music became influenced by ragtime and jazz, before being overtaken by them.</p>
<p>Music hall songs were often composed with their working class audiences in mind. Songs like 'My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)', 'Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road', and 'Waiting at the Church', expressed in melodic form situations with which the urban poor were very familiar. Music Hall songs could be romantic, patriotic, humorous or sentimental, as the need arose. The most popular Music Hall songs became the basis for the Pub songs of the typical Cockney "knees up".</p>
<p>Although a number of songs show a sharply ironic and knowing view of working class life, no doubt a larger number were repetitive, derivative, written quickly and sung to make a living rather than a work of art.</p>
<p>The typical music hall comedian was a man or woman, usually dressed 'in character' to suit the subject of the song, or sometimes attired in absurd and eccentric style. Until well into the twentieth century the acts were essentially vocal, with songs telling a story, accompanied by a minimum of patter. They included a variety of genres, including:</p>
<p>Lions Comiques: essentially, men dressed as a 'toff', who sang songs about drinking champagne, going to the races, going to the ball, womanising and gambling, and living the life of an Aristocrat.</p>
<p>Male and female impersonators, perhaps more in the style of a pantomime dame than a modern drag queen. Nevertheless these included some more sophisticated performers such as Vesta Tilley, whose male impersonations communicated real social commentary.</p>
<p>'Stand up', spoken wisecracking acts and double acts with one performer being prompted and interrupted by a 'straight' partner, belong to later developments, derived partly from pantomime and partly from the importation of American comedy styles. The phrases 'I don't wish to know that!' and 'kindly leave the stage!' and some of today's habits, such as finishing on a song, belong to this later period. Inter-war radio programmes such as Band Wagon adapted the music hall and variety traditions to the new medium, while later, 'The Goon Show' took radio comedy into the surreal. Early television variety show picked up some of the pieces, but this was at a time when music hall was already on its last legs. Nearer to today, the spirit of music hall genre has enjoyed a new kind of life in television's 'The Muppet Show.'</p>

			<h1>Opera</h1>
<p>Opera (English plural: operas; Italian plural: opere) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. </p>
<p>Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble.</p>
<p>Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition. It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Schutz in Germany,Lully in France, and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe, except France, attracting foreign composers such as Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. Today the most renowned figure of late 18th century opera is Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze Di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Cosi fan tutte, as well as The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflote), a landmark in the German tradition.</p>
<p>The first third of the 19th century saw the highpoint of the bel canto style, with Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini all creating works that are still performed today. It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer. The mid-to-late 19th century was a "golden age" of opera, led and dominated by Wagner in Germany and Verdi in Italy. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary opera through to Puccini and Strauss in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Schoenberg and Berg), Neoclassicism (Stravinsky), and Minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso became known to audiences beyond the circle of opera fans. Operas were also performed on (and written for) radio and television.</p>
<p>The words of an opera are known as the libretto (literally "little book"). Some composers, notably Richard Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte. Traditional opera, often referred to as "number opera", consists of two modes of singing: recitative, the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech, and aria (an "air" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as Singspiel, opera comique, operetta, and semi-opera, the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as arioso. During the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms: secco (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by continuo, which was usually a harpsichord and a cello; oraccompagnato (also known as strumentato) in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. By the 19th century, accompagnato had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Richard Wagner revolutionised opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what he termed "endless melody". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his 'The Rake's Progress' have bucked the trend. The terminology of the various kinds of The word opera means "work" in Italian (it is the plural of Latin opus meaning "work" or "labour") suggesting that it combines the arts of solo and choral singing, declamation, acting and dancing in a staged spectacle. 'Dafne' by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the "Camerata de' Bardi". Significantly, Dafne was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the "chorus" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of "restoring" this situation. Dafne is unfortunately lost. A later work by Peri, Euridice, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to Claudio Monteverdi's 'L'Orfeo', composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. The Mantua court of the Gonzagas, employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598), but also one of the first actual "opera singers"; Madama Europa. </p>
<p>Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" (Carnival) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, 'Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria' and 'L'incoronazione di Poppea,' for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by Venice's Arcadian Academy which came to be associated with the poet Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of opera seria, which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa.</p>
<p>Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera." One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still less cultured than the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in-between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.</p>
<p>Opera seria was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of secco recitative interspersed with long da capo arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of opera seria the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the castrato voice; castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino, as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni, became in great demand throughout Europe as opera seria ruled the stage in every country except France. Indeed, Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself writing for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the classical period as well, for example in the operas of Mozart, who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of opera seria include Alessandro Scarlatti, Vivaldi and Porpora.</p>
<p>Opera seria had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. Francesco Algarotti's 'Essay on the Opera' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for Christoph Willibald Gluck's reforms. He advocated that opera seria had to return to basics and that all the various elements music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging-must be subservient to the overriding drama. Several composers of the period, including Niccolo Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta, attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a "beautiful simplicity". This is evident in his first reform opera, 'Orfeo ed Euridice', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.</p>
<p>Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comedies, notably Cos졦an tutte, The Marriage of Figaro, and Don Giovanni (in collaboration with Lorenzo Da Ponte) which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to opera seria was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as' Idomeneo' and 'La clemenza di Tito', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again</p>
<p>The bel canto opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Pacini, Mercadante and many others. Literally "beautiful singing", bel canto opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control.</p>
<p>Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by Giuseppe Verdi, beginning with his biblical opera 'Nabucco'. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of Italian nationalism in the post-Napoleonic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement (although his own politics were perhaps not quite so radical). In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: 'Rigoletto', 'Il trovatore' and 'La traviata'. But he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French Grand Opera, 'Don Carlos', and ending his career with two Shakespeare-inspired works, 'Otello' and 'Falstaff', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century.</p>
<p>After Verdi, the sentimental "realistic" melodrama of verismo appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by Pietro Mascagni's 'Cavalleria Rusticana' and Ruggiero Leoncavallo's 'Pagliacc'i that came virtually to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as Giacomo Puccini's 'La boheme', 'Tosca', and 'Madama Butterfly'. Later Italian composers, such as Berio and Nono, have experimented with modernism</p>
<p>The first German opera was 'Dafn'e, composed by Heinrich Schutz in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms developed too. In 1644 Sigmund Staden produced the first Singspiel, 'Seelewig', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theatre am Gansemarkt in Hamburg presented German operas by Keiser, Telemann and Handel. Yet many of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as Graun, Hasse and later Gluck, chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian.</p>
<p>Mozart's 'Singspiele', 'Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail' (1782) and 'Die Zauberflote' (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by Beethoven with his Fidelio, inspired by the climate of the French Revolution. Carl Maria von Weber established German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian bel canto. His 'Der Freischutz' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include Marschner, Schubert, Schumann and Lortzing, but the most significant figure was undoubtedly Wagner.</p>
<p>Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of Weber and Meyerbeer, he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a Gesamtkunstwerk (a "complete work of art"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. In his mature music dramas, 'Tristan und Isolde', 'Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg', 'Der Ring des Nibelungen' and 'Parsifal', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of "endless melody". He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of leitmotivs, recurring themes often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as tonality, in his quest for greater expressivity. Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from Germanic or Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at Bayreuth with part of the patronage from Ludwig II of Bavaria, exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.</p>
<p>Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, Richard Strauss accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions. He first won fame with the scandalous 'Salome' and the dark tragedy 'Elektra', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, 'Der Rosenkavalier', where Mozart and Viennese waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal, right up until 'Capriccioin' 1942. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include Zemlinsky, Korngold, Schreker, Hindemith, Kurt Weill and the Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni. The operatic innovations of Arnold Schoenberg and his successors are discussed in the section on modernism.</p>
<p>In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of King Louis XIV. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an Academy of Music and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with 'Cadmus et Hermione', Lully and his librettist Quinault created tragedie en musique, a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive recitative which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was Jean-Philippe Rameau, who composed five tragedies en musique as well as numerous works in other genres such as opera-ballet, all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. After Rameau's death, the German Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the Parisian stage in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France:opera comique. This was the equivalent of the German singspiel, where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by Monsigny, Philidor and, above all, Gretry. During the Revolutionary period, composers such as Mehul and Cherubini, who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly "comic" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g.Gossec's 'Le triomphe de la Republique' (1793).</p>
<p>By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian bel canto, especially after the arrival of Rossini in Paris. Rossini's Guillaume Tell helped found the new genre of Grand Opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer's works, such as Les Huguenots emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter opera comique also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of Boieldieu, Auber, Herold and Adolphe Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece 'Les Troyens', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach created operetta with witty and cynical works such as 'Orphee aux enfers', as well as the opera 'Les Contes d'Hoffmann'; Charles Gounod scored a massive success with 'Faust'; and Bizet composed 'Carmen', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of Romanticism and realism, became the most popular of all opera comiques. Massenet, Saint-Saens and Delibes all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory. At the same time, the influence of Richard Wagner was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from Claude Debussy. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera 'Pelleas et Melisande' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely unWagnerian.</p>
<p>Other notable 20th century names include Ravel, Dukas, Roussel and Milhaud. Francis Poulenc is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include 'Dialogues des Carmelites') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. Olivier Messiaen's lengthy sacred drama 'Saint Francois d'Assise' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.</p>
<p>In England, opera's antecedent was the 17th century jig. This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently libellous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French masque was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. Inigo Jones became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. The approach of the English Commonwealth closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the dramatist Sir William Davenant produced 'The Siege of Rhodes.' Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by 'The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru' (1658) and 'The History of Sir Francis Drake'(1659). These pieces were encouraged by Oliver Cromwell because they were critical of Spain. With the English Restoration, foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, Thomas Shadwell's 'Psyche', patterned on the 1671 'comedie-ballet' of the same name produced by Moliere and Jean-Baptiste Lully. William Davenant produced 'The Tempest' in the same year, which was the first musical adaptation of a Shakespeare play (composed by Locke and Johnson). About 1683, John Blow composed Venus and Adonis, often thought of as the first true English-language opera.</p>
<p>Blow's immediate successor was the better known Henry Purcell. Despite the success of his masterwork 'Dido and Aeneas' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead he usually worked within the constraints of the semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as Shakespeare in Purcell's 'The Fairy-Queen' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in 'The Prophetess' (1690) and 'Bonduca' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.</p>
<p>Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne, both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being Thomas and Sally in 1760. His opera 'Artaxerxes' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, 'Love in a Village' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. </p>
<p>Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was George Frideric Handel, whose opera serias filled the London operatic stages for decades, and influenced most home-grown composers, like John Frederick Lampe, who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of Michael William Balfe, and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.</p>
<p>The only exceptions were ballad operas, such as John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera' (1728), musical burlesques, European operettas, and late Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, 'Ivanhoe'  but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of "English" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. </p>
<p>In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of Ralph Vaughan Williams and in particular Benjamin Britten, who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, Michael Nyman, has been focusing on composing operas, including Facing Goya, Man and Boy: Dada, and Love Counts.</p>
<p>Also in the 20th century, American composers like Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, Gian Carlo Menotti, Douglas Moore, and Carlisle Floyd began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as Philip Glass, Mark Adamo, John Corigliano, Robert Moran, John Coolidge Adams, Andre Previn and Jake Heggie.</p>
<p>Opera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the Italian operatic troupes and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and aristocracy. Many foreign composers such as Baldassare Galuppi, Giovanni Paisiello, Giuseppe Sarti, and Domenico Cimarosa (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the Italian language. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like Maksym Berezovsky and Dmitry Bortniansky were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was 'Tsefal i Prokris' by the Italian composer Francesco Araja (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers Vasily Pashkevich, Yevstigney Fomin and Alexey Verstovsky.</p>
<p>However, the real birth of Russian opera came with Mikhail Glinka and his two great operas 'A Life for the Tsar' (1836) and 'Ruslan and Lyudmila' (1842). After him in the 19th century in Russia there were written such operatic masterpieces as 'Rusalka and The Stone Guest' by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, 'Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina' by Modest Mussorgsky, 'Prince Igor' by Alexander Borodin, 'Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades' by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and 'The Snow Maiden and Sadko' by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian nationalism across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general Slavophilism movement.</p>
<p>In the 20th century the traditions of Russian opera were developed by many composers including Sergei Rachmaninoff in his works 'The Miserly Knight' and 'Francesca da Rimini', Igor Stravinsky in 'Le Rossignol', 'Mavra', 'Oedipus Rex', and 'The Rake's Progress', Sergei Prokofiev in 'The Gambler', 'The Love for Three Oranges', 'The Fiery Angel', 'Betrothal in a Monastery', and 'War and Peace'; as well as Dmitri Shostakovich in 'The Nose' and 'Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District', Edison Denisov in 'L'ecume des jours', and Alfred Schnittke in 'Life with an Idiot'. </p>
<p>Singers and the roles they play are classified by voice type, based on the tessitura, agility, power and timbre of their voices. Male singers can be classified by vocal range as bass, bass-baritone, baritone, tenor and countertenor, and female singers as contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. (Men sometimes sing in the "female" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed sopranist or countertenor. The countertenor is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for castrati - men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by size - for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, coloratura, soubrette, spinto, or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.</p>
<p>Yet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the Basso Buffo who often must be a specialist in patter as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the Fach system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken drama were often put on by the same repertory company.</p>
<p>A particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, premiere dugazon and deuxieme dugazon, were named after successive stages in the career of Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the Parisian theatres are baryton-martin and falcon.</p>
<p>The soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a castrato. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the Classical period. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high A (Handel, for example, only wrote one role extending to a high C), though the castrato Farinelli was alleged to possess a top D (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's 'Dido and Aeneas' to such heavyweight roles as Brangane in Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing "witches, bitches, and britches" roles. In recent years many of the "trouser roles" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.</p>
<p>The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the bel canto era, such as Donizetti's sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during La fille du regiment. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as Heldentenor; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's Turandot. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in opera seria in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in 'Don Giovanni' to the nobility of Wotan in Wagner's 'Ring Cycle'. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's Cosi fan tutte to Posa in Verdi's 'Don Carlos'; the actual designation "baritone" was not standard until the mid-19th century.</p>

			<h1>Pantomime</h1>

<p>Pantomime (informally, panto) - not to be confused with the theatrical medium of mime is a musical-comedy theatrical production traditionally performed in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Africa, India, Ireland, Gibraltar, and Malta, mostly during the Christmas and New Year season. </p>
<p>
    The word derives from the Greek "&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;" (pantomimos), "pantomimic actor" and from 
	"&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#962;" (pantos), genitive of "&#960;&#8118;&#962;" (pas), "every, all" + "&#956;&#8150;&#956;&#959;&#962;" (mimos), "imitator, actor".
</p>
<p>A "pantomime" in Ancient Greece was originally a group who "imitates all" accompanied by sung narrative and instrumental music, often played on the flute. </p>
<p>The word later came to be applied to the performance itself. The pantomime was a popular form of entertainment in ancient Greece and later, Rome. </p>
<p>Like theatre, it encompassed the genres of comedy, tragedy, and sex. </p>
<p>No ancient pantomime libretto has survived, partly because the genre was looked down upon by the literary elite. Nonetheless, notable ancient poets such as Lucan wrote for the pantomime, no doubt in part because the work was well paid. </p>
<p>In a speech of the late 1st century AD now lost, the orator Aelius Aristides condemned the pantomime for its erotic content and the "effeminacy" of its dancing. </p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the Mummers Play was a traditional British folk play performed during the festive gatherings of both urban and rural communities and contain many of the archetypal elements of the contemporary "pantomime" such as stage fights, coarse humour and fantastic creatures. It is often claimed that many of these elements are the cultural remnants of pre Christian beliefs. </p>
<p>The gender role reversal resembles the old festival of Twelfth Night, a combination of Epiphany and midwinter feast, when it was customary for the natural order of things to be reversed. This tradition is sometimes traced back to pre-Christian European festivals such as Samhain and Saturnalia. </p>
<p>The pantomime horse may also be related to the Grey Mare of the British cult of the goddess Epona as it frequently surfaces in traditional British culture from Wales, Devon, Cornwall, Brittany and other parts of England.</p>
<p>The pantomime first arrived in England as entr'actes between opera pieces, eventually evolving into separate shows.</p>
<p>In Restoration England, a pantomime was considered a low form of opera, rather like the Commedia dell'arte but without 'Harlequin' (rather like the French Vaudeville). </p>
<p>In 1717, actor and manager John Rich introduced 'Harlequin' to the British stage under the name of "Lun" (for "lunatic") and began performing wildly popular pantomimes. These pantomimes gradually became more topical and comic, often involving as many special theatrical effects as possible. </p>
<p>Colley Cibber and his colleagues competed with Rich and produced their own pantomimes, and pantomime was a substantial (if decried) subgenre in Augustan drama. According to some sources, the Lincoln's Inn Field Theatre and the Drury Lane Theatre were the first to stage something like real pantomimes (in the later sense that has become codified with its fairly rigid set of conventions), creating high competition between them to put on the more elaborate performance. </p>
<p>As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, Augustus Harris is now considered the father of modern pantomime. These pantomimes were followed by, or incorporated, a Harlequinade.</p>
<p>There seems to be some disagreement among scholars as to exactly when the true pantomime genre got started. According to one eminent authority, Russell A. Peck, the John Hall Deane Professor of English at the University of Rochester, "The first Cinderella Pantomime in England was the 1804 production at Drury Lane, Dir. Mr. Byrne", with music by Michael Kelly (1762-1826). This date would seem too early for panto in its mature form, with its extensive adherence to a set of conventions, including the pantomime dame role, the principal boy played by a young woman, the animal-costume roles, audience participation, etc. But, if Peck means that this was the first pantomime in England in the older sense of "low opera", then his date seems too late, for he seems to disregard the fact that pantomime as "low opera" had already arisen in Restoration-era England, considerably prior to 1804. Even limiting this claim to 'Cinderella', one finds that other sources give 1870 as the date of the first 'Cinderella' pantomime in England. </p>
<p>In the 1800s, children went to the theatre (primarily around Christmas and New Years) to witness the craziness of the Harlequinade, or "the comic business" as it is also called. It was the most exciting part of the "panto" because it was fast paced and consisted of scenic magic as well as slapstick comedy. The presence of slapstick in this part of the show is not at all surprising considering the characters are all based on those found in Italian Commedia dell'arte, a somewhat improvised, comedic form of travelling theatre consisting of various stock characters including 'Arlecchino', 'Colombina', 'Pantalone', and 'Pulcinella'.</p>
<p>The plot of the Harlequinade was relatively simple; the star-crossed lovers, 'Harlequin' and 'Columbine', run away from Columbine's father, 'Pantaloon', who is being slowed down in his pursuit of them by his servant 'The Clown'. The Clown character is pulled from Commedia dell'arte's 'Pulcinella'. Originally, 'Harlequin' possessed magical powers that he used to help himself and his love interest escape. He would tap his wooden sword (a derivative of the Commedia dell'arte slapstick) on the floor to make a grand transition of the world around him take place. The scene would switch from being inside some house or castle to, generally speaking, the streets of the town with storefronts as the backdrop. Through reading many transition sequences from different pantomimes, however, it becomes clear that this narration and the creation new scene in later pantomimes typically instigated by the Fairy Godmother character from the Fairy Story.</p>
<p>The Opening, or Fairy Story, follows the familiar plotline of a fairy tale or nursery rhyme. The stories still popular today include "Aladdin", "Little Red Riding Hood", "Cinderella", and "Puss in Boots". Most of these stories' pantomime titles would have included the words "Harlequin and", or something of that sort, at the beginning as he was the most important character of the "panto" for quite a long time. Eventually, the Opening became the more popular part of the production and by the 1870s, the Harlequinade had mostly died out of fashion, although most authors of books on the subject seem to agree that "pantos" were better when the Harlequinade still held a large place in the night's festivities. Possibly more interesting than "the comic business" itself was the transition into it.</p>
<p>While the familiarity of the audience with the original story is generally assumed, plot lines are almost always 'adapted' for comic or satirical effect, it being common for characters and situations from other stories to be interpolated into the plot. Certain familiar scenes tend to recur, regardless of plot relevance, and highly unlikely resolution of the plot is common. Straight re-tellings of the original stories are rare.</p>
<p>The form has a number of conventions, some of which have changed or weakened a little over the years, and by no means all of which are obligatory. Some of these conventions were once common to other genres of popular theatre such as melodrama.</p>
<p>The leading male juvenile character (the principal boy) is traditionally played by a young woman, usually in tight-fitting male garments (such as breeches) that make her female charms evident.</p>
<p>An older woman (the pantomime dame - often the hero's mother) is usually played by a man in drag.</p>
<p>Risque double entendre, often wringing innuendo out of perfectly innocent phrases. This is, in theory, over the heads of the children in the audience.</p>
<p>Audience participation, including calls of "He's behind you!" (or "Look behind you!"), and "Oh, yes it is!" and "Oh, no it isn't!" The audience is always encouraged to boo the villain and "awwwww" the poor victims, such as the rejected dame, who usually fancies the prince.</p>
<p>Music may be original but is more likely to combine well-known tunes with re-written lyrics. At least one "audience participation" song is traditional: one half of the audience may be challenged to sing "their" chorus louder than the other half. Children in the audience may even be invited on stage to sing along with members of the cast.</p>
<p>The animal, played by an actor in "animal skin" or animal costume. It is often a pantomime horse or cow, played by two actors in a single costume, one as the head and front legs, the other as the body and back legs.</p>
<p>The good fairy enters from stage right (from the audience's point of view this is on the left) and the villain enters from stage left (right from the point of view of the audience). This convention goes back to the medieval mystery plays, where the right side of the stage symbolised Heaven and the left side symbolised Hell.</p>
<p>A slapstick comedy routine may be performed, often a decorating or baking scene, with humour based on throwing messy substances. Until the 20th century, British pantomimes often concluded with a harlequinade, a free-standing entertainment of slapstick. Nowadays the slapstick is more or less incorporated into the main body of the show.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, until the 1880s, pantomimes typically included a transformation scene in which a Fairy Queen magically transformed the pantomime characters into the characters of the harlequinade, who then performed the harlequinade. </p>
<p>The Chorus, who can be considered extras on-stage, and often appear in multiple scenes (but as different characters) and who perform a variety of songs and dances throughout the show. Due to their multiple roles they may have as much stage-time as the lead characters themselves.</p>
<p>Another contemporary pantomime tradition is the celebrity guest star, a practice that dates back to the late 19th century, when Augustus Harris, proprietor of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, hired well-known variety artists for his pantomimes.</p>
<p>Until the decline of the British music hall tradition by the late 1950s, many popular artists played in pantomimes across the country. Many modern pantomimes use popular artists to promote the pantomime, and the play is often adapted to allow the star to showcase their well-known act, even when such a spot has little relation to the plot, for example, Rolf Harris might perform Jake the Peg in a pantomime about Aladdin.</p>

			<h1>Physical Theatre</h1>
<p>This term is used to describe any mode of performance that pursues storytelling or drama through primarily physical and secondarily mental means.</p>
<p>Several traditions of performance all describe themselves as "physical theatre." It can be used to help the actors gain a better understanding of the plays, but there has been some considerable confusion as to how physical theatre should be defined. The means of expression seem to be primarily physical rather than textual, often augmented by musical elements. </p>
<p>Some analysts believe that physical theatre was influenced primarily through Western culture by theatrical experimentalists Bertolt Brecht and Jerzy Grotowski. An Eastern strain of physical theatre is taught from the writings and disciplines of Tadashi Suzuki. Further research into the training or "work" of these artists cites an amalgamation of numerous techniques re-purposed and/or re-introduced as a means to further inform the present theatrical research/production.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>Work is often devised, rather than originated from a pre-existing script. (An exception to this is the troupe Shared Experience, which focuses on making contemporary reinterpretations of highly literary plays including 'A Doll's House' by Ibsen and 'War and Peace' by Tolstoy).</p>
<p>Work has inter-disciplinary origins - it crosses between music, dance, visual art as well as theatre.</p>
<p>Work challenges the traditional, proscenium arch, performer/audience relationship.</p>
<p>Work celebrates the non-passive audience.</p>
<p>Work utilises the imagination of the audience in conjunction with the imagination of the performers.</p>
<p>The definition of physical theatre is not easy to describe. This is partly due to multiple origins, and partly due to the discomfort that most practitioners have with the definition. </p>
<p>Contemporary theatre including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, and post-dramatic performance, while having their own distinct definitions, is often simply labelled "physical theatre" without any reason other than because it is unusual in some way.</p>
<p>It is also problematic that dance is of a theatrical nature. A dance piece will be called "physical theatre" because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative; it is theatrical and physical but does not necessarily share anything in common with a potential (and nascent) physical theatre tradition.</p>
<p>Modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. Mime and theatrical clowning schools, such as L'ecole Internationale de Theatre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as Steven Berkoff and John Wright received their initial training at such institutions. Contemporary Dance has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a level of physical control and flexibility. Those qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as Commedia dell'arte and some suggest links to the ancient Greek theatre, particularly the theatre of Aristophanes.</p>
<p>Another tradition started with the very famous French master Etienne Decroux (father of corporeal mime). Etienne Decroux's aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor allowing the creation of a more metaphorical theatre. This tradition has grown and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools.</p>
<p>Arguably, the point at which, physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when Jean-Louis Barrault (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher's notion that the mime should be silent. If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as "Total Theatre" and he advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. This viewed each element as equally important, and that each should be explored for their possibilities.</p>
<p>Barrault was a member of Michel St.Denis's company, alongside Antonin Artaud.  Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the proscenium arch is disposed of in order to have a more direct relationship with the audience.</p>
<p>Eastern Theatre traditions have influenced a number of practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese Noh tradition, in particular has been drawn upon a lot. Antonin Artaud was fascinated with the energy and visual nature of Balinese theatre and wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, Jacques Copeau and Joan Littlewood have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese Theatre Practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. Tadashi Suzuki drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through Anne Bogart's Collaboration with him and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the Viewpoints method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the Butoh Movement, which originated from Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohnocontained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask etc.)</p>
<p>As well as ideas outside of the western theatre tradition creeping in gradually, there is a tradition from within Western theatre, too, starting with Stanislavski. Stanislavski, later on in life, began to reject his own ideas of naturalism, and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. This work was influenced and developed by Peter Brook.</p>
<p>Contemporary dance has added to this mix significantly, starting particularly with Rudolf von Laban. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside of codified dance and was useful in looking at, and creating, movement not just for dancers but for actors too. Later on, the Tanzteater of Pina Bausch and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the post-modern dance movement of the Judson Church Dance also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and somatic training are equally accessible for those with a dance training as those with a theatre training. </p>

			<h1>Restoration Comedy</h1>
<p>Written from 1670-1710.</p>
<p>Also called 'comedy of manners'.</p>
<p>Signaled a renaissance of English Drama in 1660 after an 18 year ban by the Puritan regime. It is known for its sexual explicitness which was encouraged by Charles II and his aristocratic court. Plays had a bawdy reputation e.g. William Wytcherly's 'The Country Wife' was 'the most obscene play in the English language' at the time. </p>
<p>Attracted a socially diverse audience as it mocks upper classes and society.</p>
<p>Theme: "Marriage and the game of love."</p>
<p>Witty dialogue, multi-plot action and fast paced.</p>
<p>Included 2 dimensional caricatures</p>
<p>Exaggerated fops and rakes</p>
<p>'Straight' characters that the comedy bounced off.</p>
<p>Character names often mirrored their nature/ characteristics e.g. 'Sir John Brute' in 'The Provok'd Wife' was a drunken wife beater.</p>
<p>Performed by two competing theatre companies, called The Dukes and The Kings. Both were granted exclusive play-staging rights by Charles II (Royal Patents). Thomas Killigrew would lead The King's Company and William Davenant would lead The Duke's . Competition meant that both theatres were quite similar. Both were designed by Christopher Wren, both optimally provided for singing and dancing and both utilised movable scenery. This enabled performers to negotiate contracts, creating the first 'celebrities'.</p>
<p>Celebrities of the day included Nell Gwynn (Charles II mistress), Thomas Betterton, Elizabeth Barry, Anne Bracegirdle.</p>
<p>Audience numbers during the early Restoration Period (1660-1682) were small and could barely support the two companies. Fashions in drama would change weekly and playwrights had to be responsive to popular taste. Out of this, new genres such as Heroic and Pathetic were born.</p>
<p>Women were allowed to perform for the first time.  Actresses characters were often dressed in disguise as men to allow them to do things women of the time would not normally do. These were known as 'the breeches role'.</p>
<p>The first female playwright was Alphra Behn who wrote 'The Rover'.</p>
<p>1682 The Dukes and The Kings amalgamated which meant a cut in pay and jobs. </p>
<p>1695, Performers had the audience on their side and in knowing this would walk out of the United Theatre to form their own. The actors gained a Royal Patent and formed their own cooperative company meaning that London again had two competing companies. Whilst this would see a brief comeback in Restoration Comedy, the genre would eventually fall into decline once more with the United Theatre resorting to using Bartholomew Fair-type attractions. Despite claiming to be the only legitimate theatre company, the cooperating actors were not above using similar methods.</p>
<p>There was a swing from comedy to more political based dramas.</p>
<p>1690's - saw the introduction of 'softer' comedies where the emphasis was on the relationships not sex.</p>

			<h1>Roman Theatre</h1>
<p>Began 364BC.</p>
<p>The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama however no plays from either writer have survived.</p>
<p>While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies.</p>
<p>Their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the development of each type of drama.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (collegium poetarum) had been formed.</p>
<p>Often performances were for a festival.</p>
<p>Roman Theatre was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to Plautus's situation comedies, to the verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca.</p>
<p>Paid for by a wealthy citizen as a gift to the townsfolk.</p>
<p>Actors toured in troupes and were called 'histriones' (hiss-tree-own-ay-z).</p>
<p>It was usually based on Greek myths and included 4 forms- tragedy/ comedy/ pantomime/ mime.</p>
<p>It was usually performed in the daytime, usually around lunchtime.</p>
<p>Some sections were sung like operas. A Roman orchestra consisted of flute, drums, pipes, cymbals and lyre. It Introduced music under the dialogue and action.</p>
<p>The stage had no curtain, no scenery that could be changed. Simple houses painted with doors and windows that opened on two levels for overhearing conversations and was usually set outside in the street.</p>
<p>Plot based on a conversation being overheard.</p>
<p>Used costumes and masks.</p>
<p>Stock characters- Bucco - (translated means 'mouth)- loud, boisterous, bragger; Pappas - foolish old man, often confused; Dossenus - a frightening, drunken, swindler of a hunchback; Maccus - gluttonous, greedy fool.</p>
<p>It began to become less popular with the downfall of the Roman Empire. There was also opposition from the church. Plays sometimes scoffed the church and its morals by exploring them physically, visually, literally and by sometimes referring to supernatural events and beings. Also, Roman people were more interested in law and oratory skills (speaking), than theatre and poetry.</p>

			<h1>Satire</h1>
<p>Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, and society itself, into improvement. </p>
<p>Although satire is usually meant to be funny, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit as a weapon.</p>
<p>A common feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm "in satire, irony is militant" but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.</p>
<p>Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including literature, plays, commentary, and media such as lyrics.</p>
<p>The word satire comes from the Latin word satur and the subsequent phrase lanx satura. Satur meant "full," but the juxtaposition with lanx shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression lanx satura literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits." </p>
<p>The word satura as used by Quintilian, however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as satire. Quintilian famously said that satura, that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (satura tota nostra est). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to beAristophanes' Old Comedy. The first critic to use satire in the modern broader sense was Apuleius</p>
<p>Laughter is not an essential component of satire, in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and burlesque.</p>
<p>Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the Ig Nobel Prize describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".</p>
<p>Satire and irony in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of social study. They provide the keenest insights into a group's collective psyche, reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power. Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or anthropology. In a prominent example from Ancient Greece, philosopher Plato, when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of Aristophanes. </p>
<p>The state of political satire in a given country reflects the state of civil liberties and human rights. Under totalitarian regimes any criticism of a political system including satire is suppressed. A typical example is the Soviet Union where the dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the USSR was allowed, the most prominent satirist being Arkady Raikin, political satire existed in the form of anecdotes that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially Brezhnev, famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.</p>
<p>Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist Horace (65-8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society. An example of this would be 'Have I Got News For You', BBC/Hat Trick Productions.</p>
<p>Juvenalian satire, named after the Roman satirist Juvenal (late 1st century - early 2nd century CE), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenalian satire addresses social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humour. Strongly polarized political satire is often Juvenalian. An example of this would be,  Anthony Burgess, 'A Clockwork Orange' and Bret Easton Ellis, 'American Psycho,'</p>
<p>Nobel laureate satirical playwright Dario Fo pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (sfotto). Teasing is the reactionary side of the comic, it limits itself to a shallow parody of physical appearance; the side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a subversive character, and a moral dimension which draws judgement against its targets. Fo formulated an operational criteria to tell real satire from sfotto, saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing. Historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire. </p>
<p>Teasing (sfotto) is an ancient form of simple buffoonery, a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists in a impersonation of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, tics, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with irony; it never harms the target's conduct, ideology and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension. Sfotto directed towards a powerful individual, makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him. Hermann Goring propagated jests  and jokes against himself, with the aim of humanizing his image.</p>
<p>Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, the primary topics of literary satire are politics, religion and sex. On one hand because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and on the other hand because these topics are usually taboo, considered sacred and off-limits by social etiquette. Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire. Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs. Satire on sex may overlap with blue comedy, off-colour humour and dick jokes.</p>
<p>Scatology has a long literary association with satire. The use of scatology is closely related to the grotesque and what is sometimes called the satiric grotesque. Faeces plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes death, the turd being "the ultimate dead object." The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with shit, exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness." Satire about death overlaps with black humour, gallows humour.</p>
<p>Another classification by topics, is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners. Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. Comedy of manners, sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behaviour, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, Comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theatre in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.  </p>
<p>Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible tones: wit, ridicule, irony, sarcasm, cynicism, the sardonic and invective.</p>
<p>Direct social commentary via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of Francois Rabelais tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).</p>
<p>The Elizabethan (i.e. 16th century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French Huguenot Isaac Casaubon pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. 17th century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" (Dryden).</p>
<p>In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of Hall's 'Virgidemiarum', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although Donne had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model. The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire - much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's - until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship. </p>
<p>The Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th century advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties - and also, in 1714, by the formation of the Scriblerus Club, which included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Thomas Parnell, and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. This club included several of the notable satirists of early 18th century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship". In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon.</p>
<p>Jonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his 'A Modest Proposal' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book 'Gulliver's Travels' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. </p>
<p>Daniel Defoe pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his 'The True-Born Englishman' which mocks xenophobic patriotism.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was a great American satirist: his novel 'Huckleberry Finn' is set in the antebellum South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but good-hearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway slave. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. Ironically, he is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.</p>
<p>Twain's younger contemporary Ambrose Bierce gained notoriety as a cynic, pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the American Civil War, which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably 'The Devil's Dictionary', in which the definitions mock cant, hypocrisy and received wisdom.</p>
<p>Novelists such as Charles Dickens often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues. Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the Victorian era and Edwardian period, such as 'unch and Fun.'</p>
<p>Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the Savoy Operas of W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, satire was used by authors such as Aldous Huxley and George Orwell to make serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe and United States. The film 'The Great Dictator' (1940) by Charlie Chaplin is a satire on Adolf Hitler. </p>
<p>The film 'Dr. Strangelove' from 1964 was a popular satire on the Cold War. A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the Satire Boom, led by such luminaries as Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore, whose stage show 'Beyond the Fringe' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include David Frost, Eleanor Bron and the television program 'That Was The Week That Was'.  </p>
<p>One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is Chris Morris, co-writer and director of Four Lions.</p>
<p>Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as 'Mock the Week' and 'Have I Got News for You'. </p>
<p>Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of poor taste, or that "it's just not funny" for instance), to the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in 'A Modest Proposal', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism. Some critics of Mark Twain see 'Huckleberry Finn' as racist and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in 'Huckleberry Finn'). This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire 'Till Death Us Do Part'. The character of Alf Garnett (played by Warren Mitchell) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, little-Englander that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort ofnanti-hero to people who actually agreed with his views. </p>
<p>In 2006 British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen released 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', a "mockumentary" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. Criticism of the film was heavy, from claims of anti-semitism (despite the fact that Baron Cohen is Jewish) to the massive boycott of the film by the Kazakh government; the film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.</p>

			<h1>Shakespeare</h1>
<p>William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) - 23 April 1616) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. </p>
<p>He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". </p>
<p>His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, two epitaphs on a man named John Combe, one epitaph on Elias James, and several other poems. </p>
<p>His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. </p>
<p>Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. </p>
<p>His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including 'Hamlet', 'King Lear', 'Othello', and 'Macbeth', considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called "bardolatry". In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual birth date remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, St George's Day. This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, since Shakespeare died 23 April 1616. He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son. </p>
<p>Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but the grammar curriculum was standardised by royal decree throughout England, and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar based upon Latin classical authors. </p>
<p>At the age of 18, Shakespeare married the 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste, since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596. </p>
<p>After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592, and scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years". </p>
<p>It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.  </p>
<p>From 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed by only the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king, James I, and changed its name to the King's Men. </p>
<p>In 1599, a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they called the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man. In 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, he invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford. </p>
<p>Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions from 1594. By 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for 'Every Man in His Humour' (1598) and 'Sejanus His Fall' (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's 'Volpone' is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after 'Volpone', although we cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that "good Will" played "kingly" roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in 'As You Like It' and the Chorus in 'Henry V', though scholars doubt the sources of the information. </p>
<p>Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear. </p>
<p>After 1606-1607, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King's Men. </p>
<p>Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 and was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death. </p>
<p>In his will, Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna. The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body". The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line. Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically. He did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance. </p>
<p>Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death. The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008: </p>
<p>Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare, To digg the dvst encloased heare. Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones, And cvrst be he yt moves my bones. </p></p>
<p>(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, | To dig the dust enclosed here. | Blessed be the man that spares these stones, | And cursed be he that moves my bones.)</p>
<p>Sometime before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil. In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published. </p>
<p>Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.</p>

			<h1>Silent Movies</h1>
<p>A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. </p>
<p>In silent films for entertainment the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime (US: pantomime) and title cards. </p>
<p>The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system.</p>
<p>After the release of 'The Jazz Singer' in 1927, "talkies" became more and more commonplace. Within a decade, popular widespread production of silent films had the first projected primary proto-movie was made by Eadweard Muybridge some time between 1877 and 1880. The first narrative film was created by Louis Le Prince in 1888. It was a two-second film of people walking in Oakwood streets garden, entitled 'Roundhay Garden Scene'.</p>
<p>The visual quality of silent movies especially those produced in the 1920s was often high. However, there is a widely held misconception that these films were primitive and barely watchable by modern standards. This misconception comes as a result of silent films being played back at wrong speed and their deteriorated condition. </p>
<p>In addition, many prints may suffer from censorship cuts and missing frames and scenes, resulting in what may appear to be poor editing.</p>
<p>As motion pictures eventually increased in length, a replacement was needed for the in-house interpreter who would explain parts of the film. Because silent films had no synchronized sound for dialogue, onscreen intertitles were used to narrate story points, present key dialogue and sometimes even comment on the action for the cinema audience. The title writer became a key professional in silent film and was often separate from the scenario writer who created the story. Intertitles (ortitles as they were generally called at the time) often became graphic elements themselves, featuring illustrations or abstract decoration that commented on the action.</p>
<p>Showings of silent films almost always featured live music, starting with the pianist at the first public projection of movies by the Lumiere Brothers on December 28, 1895 in Paris. From the beginning, music was recognized as essential, contributing to the atmosphere and giving the audience vital emotional cues. (Musicians sometimes played on film sets during shooting for similar reasons.) Small town and neighbourhood movie theatres usually had a pianist. Beginning in the mid-1910s, large city theatres tended to have organists or ensembles of musicians. Massive theatre organs were designed to fill a gap between a simple piano soloist and a larger orchestra. </p>
<p>Theatre organs had a wide range of special effects; theatrical organs such as the famous "Mighty Wurlitzer" could simulate some orchestral sounds along with a number of percussion effects such as bass drums and cymbals and sound effects ranging from galloping horses to rolling thunder.</p>
<p>Film scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D. W. Griffith's groundbreaking epic 'The Birth of a Nation' (USA, 1915) it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theatre with original, specially composed scores. However, the first designated full blown scores were composed earlier, in 1908, by Camille Saint-Saens, for 'The Assassination of the Duke of Guise,' and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, for 'Stenka Razin.'</p>
<p>When organists or pianists used sheet music, they still might add improvisatory flourishes to heighten the drama on screen. Even when special effects were not indicated in the score, if an organist was playing a theatre organ capable of an unusual sound effect, such as a "galloping horses" effect, it would be used for dramatic horseback chases.</p>
<p>By the height of the silent era, movies were the single largest source of employment for instrumental musicians (at least in America). But the introduction of talkies, which happened simultaneously with the onset of the Great Depression, was devastating to many musicians.</p>
<p>Some countries devised other ways of bringing sound to silent films. The early cinema of Brazil featured fitas cantatas: filmed operettas with singers performing behind the screen. In Japan, films had not only live music but also the benshi, a live narrator who provided commentary and character voices. The benshi became a central element in Japanese film, as well as providing translation for foreign (mostly American) movies. The popularity of the benshi was one reason why silent films persisted well into the 1930s in Japan.</p>
<p>Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic orcampy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures." In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen. </p>
<p>In any case, the large image size and unprecedented intimacy the actor enjoyed with the audience began to affect acting style, making for more subtlety of expression. Actresses such as Mary Pickford in all her films, Eleonora Duse in the Italian film 'Cenere' (1916), Janet Gaynor in 'Sunrise', Priscilla Dean in 'Outside the Law' and 'White Tiger', and Lillian Gish and Greta Garbo in most of their performances made restraint and easy naturalism in acting a virtue. Directors such as Albert Capellani (a French director who also did work in America directing Alla Nazimova films) and Maurice Tourneur insisted on naturalism in their films. Tourneur had been just such a minimalist in his prior stage productions. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as 'Metropolis', were still being released. Some viewers liked the flamboyant acting for its escape value, and some countries were later than the United States in embracing naturalistic style in their films. Just as today, a film's success depended upon the setting, the mood, the script, the skills of the director, and the overall talent of the cast.</p>
<p>Until the standardization of the projection speed of 24 frames per second (fps) for sound films between 1926 and 1930, silent films were shot at variable speeds (or "frame rates") anywhere from 12 to 26 fps, depending on the year and studio. "Standard silent film speed" is often said to be 16 fps as a result of the Lumiere brothers' Cinematographe, but industry practice varied considerably; there was no actual standard. Cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly 16 fps, but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error, that they often cranked faster. Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow and at a slow speed carried a risk of fire. However, some scenes were intentionally under-cranked during shooting to accelerate the action-particularly for comedies and action films. </p>
<p>With the lack of natural colour processing available, films of the silent era were frequently dipped in dyestuffs and dyed various shades and hues to signal a mood or represent a time of day. Blue represented night scenes, yellow or amber meant day. Red represented fire and green represented a mysterious atmosphere. Similarly, toning of film (such as the common silent film generalization of sepia-toning) with special solutions replaced the silver particles in the film stock with salts or dyes of various colours. A combination of tinting and toning could be used as an effect that could be striking.</p>
<p>Some films were hand-tinted, such as 'Annabelle Serpentine Dance' (1894), from Edison Studios. In it, Annabelle Whitford, a young dancer from Broadway, is dressed in white veils that appear to change colours as she dances. This technique was designed to capture the effect of the live performances of Loie Fuller, beginning in 1891, in which stage lights with coloured gels turned her white flowing dresses and sleeves into artistic movement. Hand colouring was often used in the early "trick" and fantasy films of Europe, especially those by Georges Melies. Melies began hand-tinting his work as early as 1897 and the 1899 'Cendrillion' (Cinderella) and 1900 'Jeanne d'Arc' (Joan of Arc) provide early examples of hand-tinted films in which the colour was a critical part of the scenography or mise an scene; such precise tinting used the workshop of Elisabeth Thuillier in Paris, with teams of female artists adding layers of colour to each frame by hand rather than using a more common (and less expensive) process of stenciling. </p>
<p>By the beginning of the 1910s, with the onset of feature-length films, tinting was used as another mood setter, just as commonplace as music. The director D. W. Griffith displayed a constant interest and concern about colour, and used tinting as a special effect in many of his films. His 1915 epic, 'The Birth of a Nation', used a number of colours, including amber, blue, lavender, and a striking red tint for scenes such as the "burning of Atlanta" and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at the climax of the picture. Griffith later invented a colour system in which coloured lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a colour effect.</p>

			<h1>Sitcom</h1>
<p>Situation comedy, often shortened to sitcom, is a genre of comedy that features characters sharing the same common environment, such as a home or workplace, accompanied with jokes as part of the dialogue. </p>
<p>Such programs originated in radio, but today, sitcoms are found almost exclusively on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.</p>
<p>A situation comedy television program may be recorded in front of a studio audience. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated by the use of a laugh track.</p>
<p>As opposed to stand up comedy and sketch comedy, a situation comedy has a storyline and ongoing characters in, essentially, a comedic drama. </p>
<p>The situation is usually that of a family, workplace, or a group of friends through comedic sequences.</p>
<p>Traditionally comedy sketches were presented within a variety show and mixed with musical performances, as in vaudeville. The emerging mass medium of radio allowed audiences to regularly return to programs, so programs could feature the same characters and situations each episode and expect audiences to be familiar with them.</p>
<p>Sitcom humour is often character driven and by its nature running gags evolve during a series. Often the status quo of the situation is maintained from episode to episode. An episode may feature a disruption to the usual situation and the character interactions, but this will usually be settled by the episode's end and the situation returned to how it was prior to the disruption. These episodes are then linked by the overarching storyline, driving the show forward.</p>
<p>Comedies from past civilizations, such as those of Aristophanes and Menander in ancient Greece, Terence and Plautus in ancient Rome, Sudraka in ancient India, and numerous examples including Shakespeare, Moliere, the Commedia dell'arte and the Punch and Judy shows from post-Renaissance Europe, are the ancestors of the modern sitcom. Some of the characters, pratfalls, routines and situations as preserved in eyewitness accounts and in the texts of the plays themselves, are remarkably similar to those in earlier modern sitcoms such as 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Honeymooners'. </p>
<p>The first television sitcom is said to be 'Pinwright's Progress', ten episodes being broadcast on the BBC between 1946-1947. In the U.S., director and producer William Asher has been credited with being the "man who invented the sitcom," having directed over two dozen of the leading sitcoms, including 'I Love Lucy'.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has produced a wealth of sitcoms, many of which have been exported to other nations or adapted for other countries. There is often a tendency towards black humour. A frequent theme in British sitcoms is that of people trapped in an unpleasant situation ('Porridge', 'Allo 'Allo!) or a dysfunctional relationship ('Only Fools and Horses', 'Rising Damp' and 'Steptoe and Son').</p>
<p>British sitcoms have also tended to shy away from the folksy homespun nature of the American sitcom and into more adult or intellectual territory - 'Yes, Minister' being an example of the latter. </p>
<p>The BBC has had more success with this format than its commercial counterpart ITV. This is attributed to the fact that ITV has to allow for commercial breaks so programmes are several minutes shorter and thus do not allow for character and plot development. </p>
<p>Sitcoms such as 'Peep Show' are shot with a point of view camera, which switches between the various characters, so that characters are seen talking directly into the camera.	</p>
<p>Most North American sitcoms are generally half-hour programs in which the story is written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for commercials. </p>
<p>Sitcoms made outside the US may run somewhat longer or shorter than 22 minutes. US commercial broadcasters have traditionally been very reluctant to run shows that run too short or too long. Thus, very few UK or British Commonwealth sitcoms run on US commercial television. </p>
<p>US sitcoms (like other American television series) typically have long season runs of 20 or more episodes due to the way they are produced. Canadian sitcoms typically only have season runs of 14 on average. British sitcoms have much shorter seasons in comparison where there are usually six episodes.</p>
<p>American sitcoms are often written by large teams of US resident script writers during round-table sessions, but some US sitcoms often do have episodes written by a guest writer. Most British sitcoms are written by one or two people, with four writers sometimes being the norm for some series in the recent past. </p>
<p>Usually sitcoms from the U.S. have satire and slapstick comedy in their status. America has made numerous sitcoms since 1947, including sitcoms aimed specifically at children and teenagers. A sub-genre of U.S. sitcoms, seen as early as the 1950s but more prominent since the 1970s, is the black sitcom, a sitcom featuring a predominantly African American cast.</p>
<p>Sitcoms, past and present, portray our culture's ideology on the "traditional family" and the way it has evolved over the years. They often mirror the societal changes happening around them while portraying a comical, entertaining family that viewers themselves would like to have. Sitcoms from the past often depicted picture-perfect families with conservative values. Now, the obviously named show 'Modern Family' has incorporated today's more tolerable and not so "normal" cultural standards. In the past, sitcoms portrayed family members with gender and age related power, as well as those with different relationship preferences, from a narrow point of view whereas present ones show the extreme evolution of these topics as today's culture becomes more and more accepting.</p>
<p>'I Love Lucy' brought a new way of filming sitcoms, with Desi Arnaz, the early innovator in the history of sitcoms, who is credited with the first successful use of the multiple-camera setup, where three cameras shoot the action on stage simultaneously and the best shots from each of the cameras are later edited together. The show starred Lucille Ball (Lucy Ricardo) with her husband Desi Arnaz (Ricky Ricardo). They created it together with actors Vivian Vance (Ethel Mertz) and William Frawley (Fred Mertz), and a creative writing team.' I Love Lucy' was also among the first to record all multiple-camera episodes on film. With their Desilu Productions studio company, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are credited with foreseeing the viability and prosperity of the rerun television program series.</p>
<p>A trend beginning in the 1960s was the expansion of the domestic comedy beyond the nuclear family or married couple. 'The Andy Griffith Show' and 'My Three Sons' featured widowers and their children. At the end of the decade, Sherwood Schwartz's 'The Brady Bunch' focused on a blended family.</p>
<p>By the mid-1960s, sitcom creators began adding more fantastical elements to live action sitcoms in the so-called "high concept" style. The regular characters of 'The Munsters' were modelled on the Universal Monsters and the eccentric 'The Addams Family' sprang from a series of cartoon comics. Genies and witches featured in 'I Dream of Jeannie' and 'Bewitched', respectively.</p>
<p>Sitcom production of the 1960s mainly used the single camera filming style, which was more practical given the visual effects used in these shows. This allowed for the careful creation of special effects and sharp editing, features which were not possible with the same finesse in a multi-camera production. Many of these programs were not filmed before live audiences, and featured a laugh track.</p>
<p>The animated sitcom was born during this period with Hanna-Barbera's 'The Flintstones' and 'The Jetsons'. The latter show was the first example of the science fiction sitcom subgenre.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s sitcoms began to address controversial issues in a serious way, and largely returned to the three-camera shoot before live audiences. Many programs of this era were recorded on videotape as opposed to film. About half of the sitcoms on broadcast television airing between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s were shot on video.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, stand-up comic Bill Cosby starred in the sitcom 'The Cosby Show', which was the earliest of the current trend of successful sitcoms built around a stand-up comic's stage persona. Comedienne Roseanne Barr continued the trend in the late 1980s with her eponymous sitcom, as did Garry Shandling ('It's Garry Shandling's Show' and 'The Larry Sanders Show'). More recently, Jerry Seinfeld ('Seinfeld') and Ray Romano ('Everybody Loves Raymond') have also made the transition from stand up to the small screen with self-starring sitcoms.</p>
<p>To some extent, many American sitcoms of the 1980s such as 'Full House', 'Family Ties', 'Who's the Boss?' and 'Growing Pains' returned to themes of family life and parent-child relationships, and centred less on the social issues that defined many 1970s sitcoms. 'Cheers', a show about the local customers in a bar, focussed on the evolving relationship between Sam and Diane.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s, the growth of cable television, additional broadcast networks, and the success of first-run syndication meant that television audiences were fracturing. Programming could now be targeted at specific audiences rather than at a "general" or "adult" audience, and this included sitcoms too. Children were one of these audiences, and among the sitcoms made specifically for children were 'Saved by the Bell'. The early 1990s saw the rebirth of the animated sitcom, a trend which continues to this day. Most notable is 'The Simpsons', the longest-running sitcom in US history. Other successful sitcoms in this subgenre include 'South Park', 'Futurama', 'Beavis and Butt-head', 'Family Guy' and 'King of the Hill'.</p>
<p>This era also saw a significant return to film origination. The main reason for this was that it was seen as "future proofing" productions against any new developments such as HDTV. Programs shot on standard definition videotape in general do not convert well to HDTV, while images on 35 mm film can easily be re-scanned to any future format. In addition, recent developments in film camera and post-processing technologies had eroded the advantages of using videotape.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s several sitcoms have featured ongoing story lines. 'Seinfeld', one of the most popular U.S. sitcoms of the 1990s, featured story arcs. Friends used soap opera elements such as the end-of-season cliff-hanger and gradually developing the relationships of the characters over the course of the series</p>
<p>The early 2000s and later saw a rebirth of the single camera shooting style for half-hour sitcoms, with shows such as 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', 'Arrested Development', 'Scrubs', 'Malcolm in the Middle'. Recently, a pastiche from the UK has been utilized in American sitcoms, as many are being shot as a pseudo-documentary (aka mockumentary), such as 'The Office', 'Modern Family'.</p>

			<h1>Soap Opera</h1>
<p>A soap opera, sometimes called "soap" for short, is an ongoing, episodic work of dramatic fiction presented in serial format on radio or as television programming. </p>
<p>The name soap opera stems from the original dramatic serials broadcast on radio that had soap manufacturers, such as Dial Corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Lever Brothers, as sponsors and producers. These early radio series were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week, when most listeners would be housewives; thus the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience. </p>
<p>A crucial element that defines soap opera is the open-ended nature of the narrative, with stories spanning several episodes. The defining feature that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is "that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode".</p>
<p>Soap opera stories run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent story threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent of each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are screened each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. </p>
<p>Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliff-hanger, and the Season Finale ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.</p>
<p>Evening soap operas and those that screen at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliff-hanger.</p>
<p>The main characteristics that define soap operas are "an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations". Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. </p>
<p>The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. "Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance meetings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from 'EastEnders' to 'Dallas'. </p>
<p>In many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the United States, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from Australia and the United Kingdom tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments. </p>
<p>Many Australian and UK soap operas explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown, or financial problems. </p>
<p>Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedy elements, often by way of affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a sort of comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare. </p>
<p>UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting "reality" or purport to have a "realistic" style. </p>
<p>UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. So 'EastEnders' focuses on the tough and grim life in London's east end; 'Coronation Street' invokes Manchester and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of "Northern straight talking".</p>
<p>Romance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine love have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In US daytime serials the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate, convoluted, and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story twists. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.</p>
<p>Australian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the "romantic quality" of criminal and/or oligarch life.</p>
<p>In soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings, and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.</p>
<p>Much like comic books-another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th Century-a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On 'The Bold and the Beautiful', Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flat-line and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005 a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.</p>
<p>Stunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off-screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets. However, some soaps have begun to do special one off stunt filled events to mark special occasions, for example 'Coronation Street' did their now famous train crash sequence to mark their 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>Due to the longevity of these shows it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Jill Foster Abbott on The Young and the Restless has been played by several different actresses. Conversely several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, most being broadcast during prime time. In comparison to US serials which frequently portray romantic storylines in sumptuous and glamorous locales, most UK soap operas focus on more everyday, working-class communities.</p>
<p>The most popular soaps are 'Coronation Street', 'EastEnders', 'Emmerdale', 'Hollyoaks', 'Doctors', and the Australian produced 'Neighbours' and 'Home and Away'. The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television.</p>
<p>The 1986 Christmas Day episode of 'EastEnders' is often given as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (in 2007, the UK had approximately 54 million viewers). The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure often sees it attributed as the highest-rated program in UK television for the 1980s, comparable to the records set by the 1970 splashdown of Apollo 13 (28.6 million viewers), and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers). </p>
<p>'Coronation Street', 'Emmerdale' and 'EastEnders' are popularly known as the "flagship" soaps, as they are the highest rating programmes for ITV and the BBC respectively. Poor ratings for a UK flagship serial sometimes brings with it questions about the associated channel. The soaps are so popular they are not routinely scheduled against each other. Episodes of serials have clashed only on isolated occasions when extended episodes have been screened.</p>
<p>Soap operas in the U.K. began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting Front Line Family in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, The Archers, which has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.</p>
<p>An early television serial was 'The Grove Family' on the BBC. 148 episodes were produced from 1954 to 1957. The series was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives.</p>
<p>In the 1960s 'Coronation Street' revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. Another of the 1960s was 'Emergency Ward 10', on ITV. The BBC also produced several serials. Compact was about the staff of a women's magazine. 'The Newcomers' was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town. 'United!' ran for 147 episodes and focused on a football team. '199 Park Lane' was an upper class serial that ran for just 18 episodes in 1965. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as 'Coronation Street'. Indeed most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.</p>
<p>During the 1960s 'Coronation Street's' main rival was 'Crossroads', a daily serial that began in 1964 and was broadcast by ITV in the early evening. 'Crossroads' was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the series was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the series through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. 'Crossroads' was cancelled in 1988. (A new version of 'Crossroads' was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003.)</p>
<p>A later rival to 'Coronation Street' was ITV's 'Emmerdale Farm' (later renamed 'Emmerdale') which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and had a rural Yorkshire setting. Increased viewing figures saw 'Emmerdale' being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.</p>
<p>'Pobol y Cwm' (People of the Valley) is a Welsh language serial produced by the BBC since October 1974. It is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC. 'Pobol y Cwm' was originally transmitted on BBC Wales television between 1974 and 1982. It then transferred to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in the November 1982. The series was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional opt out in the mid-late 1970s. 'Pobol y Cwm' was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles. It is consistently the most watched programme of the week on S4C. </p>
<p>Daytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. </p>
<p>When Channel 4 began in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool based 'Brookside,' on its first day. Over the next decade 'Brookside' redefined soap. The focus of 'Brookside' was different to previous soaps. The setting was a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike 'Coronation Street' and 'Emmerdale Farm' which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in 'Brookside' were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though 'Brookside' was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8pm and 8.30pm on weekdays, around 5pm for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel in that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (in the soaps history there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged more graphically with violence (particularly, rape) being often used.</p>
<p>For many years, soaps in the UK aired for 2 nights a week, though for some this is now 5 nights a week such is the popularity of soaps.</p>

			<h1>Surrealist Drama</h1>
<p>Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings.</p>
<p>Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artefact. Leader Andre Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>Surrealism developed out of the Dada activities during World War I and the most important centre of the movement was Paris. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.</p>
<p>World War I scattered the writers and artists who had been based in Paris, and in the interim many became involved with Dada, believing that excessive rational thought and bourgeois values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world. The Dadaists protested with anti-art gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.</p>
<p>During the war, Andre Breton, who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a neurological hospital where he used Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from shell-shock. Meeting the young writer Jacques Vache, Breton felt that Vache was the spiritual son of writer and pataphysics founder Alfred Jarry. He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. </p>
<p>Back in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal Litterature along with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. They began experimenting with automatic writing spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts-and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault delved deeper into automatism and wrote The Magnetic Fields (1920).</p>
<p>Continuing to write, they attracted more artists and writers; they came to believe that automatism was a better tactic for societal change than the Dada attack on prevailing values. The group grew to include Paul eluard, Benjamin Peret, Rene Crevel, Robert Desnos, Jacques Baron, Max Morise, Pierre Naville, Roger Vitrac, Gala eluard, Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Hans Arp, Georges Malkine, Michel Leiris, Georges Limbour, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau, Andre Masson, Joan Miro, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Prevert, and Yves Tanguy. </p>
<p>As they developed their philosophy, they believed that Surrealism would advocate the idea that ordinary and depictive expressions are vital and important, but that the sense of their arrangement must be open to the full range of imagination according to the Hegelian Dialectic. They also looked to the Marxist dialectic and the work of such theorists as Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse.</p>
<p>Freud's work with free association, dream analysis, and the unconscious was of utmost importance to the Surrealists in developing methods to liberate imagination. They embraced idiosyncrasy, while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. Later, Salvador Dali explained it as: "There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad."</p>
<p>Beside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that "one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects." Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet Pierre Reverdy, which said: "a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities. The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true, the stronger the image will be -- the greater its emotional power and poetic reality.". </p>
<p>The group aimed to revolutionize human experience, in its personal, cultural, social, and political aspects. They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was "long live the social revolution, and it alone!" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with communism and anarchism.</p>
<p>In 1924 they declared their philosophy in the first "Surrealist Manifesto". That same year they established the Bureau of Surrealist Research, and began publishing the journal La Revolution surrealiste</p>
<p>The word surrealist was first used by Guillaume Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play Les Mamelles de Tiresias (The Breasts of Tiresias), which was later adapted into an opera by Francis Poulenc.</p>
<p>Antonin Artaud, an early Surrealist, rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. He thought that rational discourse comprised "falsehood and illusion." Theorising a new theatrical form that would be immediate and direct, that would link the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created the Theatre of Cruelty, in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams. </p>
<p>The other major theatre practitioner to have experimented with surrealism in the theatre is the Spanish playwright and director Federico Garcia Lorca, particularly in his plays The Public (1930), When Five Years Pass (1931), and Play Without a Title (1935). Other surrealist plays include Aragon's Backs to the Wall (1925) and Roger Vitrac's The Mysteries of Love (1927) and Victor, or The Children Take Over (1928). Gertrude Stein's opera Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights (1938) has also been described as "American Surrealism", though it is also related to a theatrical form of cubism.</p>
<p>Surrealist theatre and Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the "Theatre of the Absurd" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. Eugene Ionesco in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history. Samuel Beckett was also fond of Surrealists, even translating much of the poetry into English. Other notable playwrights whom Esslin groups under the term, for example Arthur Adamov and Fernando Arrabal, were at some point members of the Surrealist group.</p>

			<h1>Theatre of the Absurd</h1>
<p>Started by Antonin Artaud</p>
<p>Written in the late 1940's, 50's and 60's</p>
<p>Expressed the belief that in a godless universe: - human existence has no meaning or purpose; all communication breaks down; logical argument gives way to illogical speech and ultimately, silence.</p>
<p>Well known playwrights include:- Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter, Edward Albee.</p>
<p>Coined by the critic Martin Esslin (title of book on subject in 1961) who saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to Albert Camus's philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work The Myth of Sisyphus.</p>
<p>The mode of most absurdist plays is 'tragicomedy' and Shakespeare is cited as an influence of this.</p>
<p>Mostly tragedy but also includes Commedia dell'arte and Vaudeville.</p>
<p>Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, mixed with horrific or tragic images, characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions, dialogue full of cliches, wordplay, and nonsense, plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive, either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the "well-made play".</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, The Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton have all influenced absurdist theatre.</p>
<p>Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights, they do have some common precursors.</p>
<p>Tragicomedy - The mode of most absurdist plays is tragicomedy. Esslin cites William Shakespeare as an influence on this aspect of the Absurd drama. Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's Macbeth and Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from Commedia dell'arte to Vaudeville. Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and music hall artists such as Charlie Chaplin, The Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton as direct influences.</p>
<p>Experimental theatre - As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators for example, the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear. Also employed are Brecht's distancing techniques in his Epic theatre and the dream plays of August Strindberg</p>
<p>Pataphysics - One of the most significant common precursors is Alfred Jarry whose Ubu plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of Pataphysics - the science of imaginary solutions - first presented in Jarry's Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll. Pataphysicien (Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician) was inspirational to many later Absurdists.</p>
<p>Surrealism - Artaud's The Theatre of Cruelty was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact. Artaud was a Surrealist, and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.</p>
<p>Dadaism -  Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, Dadaism. Many of the Absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and Surrealists.</p>
<p>Techniques were borrowed from earlier innovators such as Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll (Poets), Bertolt Brecht (Epic Theatre) and August Strindberg (Dream Plays).</p>
<p>The characters are often lost in an incomprehensible universe, trapped in a small space or in a routine. </p>
<p>often in pairs known as the 'pseudocouple'. </p>
<p>may be roughly equal or one more dominant who tortures the other.</p>
<p>Characters are frequently stereotypical, archetypal, or flat character types as in Commedia dell'arte.</p>
<p>The plot is </p>
<p>repetitive, full of cliche and routine. Can be cyclical, ending as it began.</p>
<p>often includes a menacing force that remains a mystery.</p>
<p>may revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis of some kind, a supernatural change. </p>
<p>Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots.</p>
<p>The language is </p>
<p>naturalistic moments where the characters resort to cliche and repetition</p>
<p>becomes nonsensical, creating misunderstanding among the characters</p>
<p>Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.</p>
<p>This makes the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.</p>
<p>The Absurd Theatre movement was originally a Paris based avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters. Some of the Absurdists were born in France such as Jean Genet, Jean Tardieu, and Boris Vian. Many other Absurdists were born elsewhere but lived in France, writing often in French for example Samuel Beckett from Ireland, Eugene Ionesco from Romania and Arthur Adamov from Russia.</p>

			<h1>Vaudeville</h1>
<p>Vaudeville was a theatrical genre of variety entertainment popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s. </p>
<p>Each performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. </p>
<p>Types of acts included popular and classical musicians, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, female and male impersonators, acrobats, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies. </p>
<p>A Vaudeville performer is often referred to as avaudevillian.</p>
<p>Vaudeville developed from many sources, including the concert saloon, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, and literary burlesque. Called "the heart of American show business," vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades.</p>
<p>The term vaudeville, referring specifically to North American variety entertainment, came into common usage after 1871 with the formation of Sergeant's Great Vaudeville Company of Louisville, Kentucky. It had little, if anything, to do with the Comedie en vaudeville of the French theatre. </p>
<p>Leavitt's and Sergeant's shows differed little from the coarser material presented in earlier itinerant entertainments, although their use of the term to provide a veneer of respectability points to an early effort to cater variety amusements to the growing middle class. Though vaudeville had been used in the United States as early as the 1830s, most variety theatres adopted the term in the late 1880s and early 1890s for two reasons. First, seeking middle class patrons, they wished to distance themselves from the earlier rowdy, working-class variety halls. Second, the French or pseudo-French term lent an air of sophistication, and perhaps made the institution seem more consistent with the Progressive Era's interests in education and self-betterment. Some, however, preferred the earlier term "variety" to what manager Tony Pastor called its "sissy and Frenchified" successor. Thus, vaudeville was marketed as "variety" well into the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In the years before the American Civil War, entertainment existed on a different scale. Certainly, variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the United States, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatregoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy. As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by travelling companies touring through cities and towns. A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured "cleaner" presentations of variety entertainment; and saloons, music halls and burlesque houses catered to those with a taste for the risque. In the 1840s, the minstrel show, another type of variety performance, and "the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture," grew to enormous. A significant influence also came from Dutch minstrels and comedians. Medicine shows travelled the countryside offering programs of comedy, music, jugglers and other novelties along with displays of tonics, salves, and miracle elixirs, while "Wild West" shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier, complete with trick riding, music and drama. Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centred in America's growing urban hubs.</p>
<p>In the early 1880s, impresario Tony Pastor, a circus ringmaster turned theatre manager, capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature "polite" variety programs in several of his New York City theatres. The usual date given for the "birth" of vaudeville is October 24, 1881 at New York's Fourteenth Street Theatre, when Pastor famously staged the first bill of self-proclaimed "clean" vaudeville in New York City. Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic uptown, Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor's experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.</p>
<p>B. F. Keith took the next step, starting in Boston, where he built an empire of theatres and brought vaudeville to the United States and Canada. Later, E. F. Albee, adoptive grandfather of the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Edward Albee, managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville's greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.</p>
<p>Albee also gave national prominence to vaudeville's trumpeting "polite" entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children. Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as "hell") were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week's remaining performances or were cancelled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this censorship, often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre. </p>
<p>This "polite entertainment" also extended to Keith's company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: "Don't say 'slob' or 'son of a gun' or 'hully gee' on the stage unless you want to be cancelled peremptorily... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority." Along these same lines of discipline, Keith's theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. </p>
<p>By the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck's Orpheum Circuit. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the United States and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of Alexander Pantages. At his hey-day Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>At its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in Peoria, Illinois, it would work anywhere. The question "Will it play in Peoria?" has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the American mainstream public. The three most common levels were the "small time" (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the "medium time" (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the "big time" (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes). As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time. The capital of the big time was New York City's Palace Theatre (or just "The Palace" in the slang of vaudevillians), built by Martin Beck in 1913 and operated by Keith. Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper Will Rogers), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheoses of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single - an individual male or female performer, next would be an alley oop - an acrobatic act, then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song and dance singles and end with a final extravaganza - either musical or drama - with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as Eubie Blake - a piano player, the famous and magical Harry Houdini and child star, Baby Rose Marie, adds Gilbert. In the New York Tribune's article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular "Circuit" - or an individual theatre chain of a major company. </p>
<p>While the neighbourhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of Italian and Yiddish. This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as "minstrel shows of antebellum America" and Yiddish theatre. PBS adds that many of these ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this travelling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the adventures that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bring bits of their own culture into this new world. White-oriented regional circuits, such as New England's "Peanut Circuit", also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material. At its height, vaudeville was rivalled only by churches and public schools among the nation's premiere public gathering places.</p>
<p>Another slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing intrigue with the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of "the blue envelopes" led to the phrase "blue" material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time. Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman's book Blue Vaudeville, the Vaudeville stage was even marked with descriptions like, "a highly sexualized space...where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of 'blue' lyrics all vied for attention." Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a "sexual delight," a fetish that historians believe emerged in the mid-nineteenth century. But more than that, these historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own "sexual spectacle" more than it ever had before. This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc. The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson's Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise coloured much of the reactions to the female entertainment of this time. </p>
<p>The shift of New York City's Palace Theatre, vaudeville's epicentre, to an exclusively cinema presentation on 16 November 1932 is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville. No single event is more reflective of its gradual withering. The line is blurred, however, by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business. For example, Alexander Pantages quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into partnership with the motion picture distributor Famous Players, a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. There was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s.</p>
<p>The continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville. This was similar to the advent of free broadcast television's diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema. Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the United States in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many early film and old-time radio performers, such as Al Jolson, W. C. Fields, Mae West,Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Jimmy Durante, Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson, Edgar Bergen, Fanny Brice, and Eddie Cantor, used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. (In so doing, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years.) Other performers who entered in vaudeville's later years, including Jack Benny, Kate Smith, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Judy Garland, Rose Marie, Sammy Davis, Jr., Red Skelton, Burns and Allen, and The Three Stooges, used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, almost no vaudeville bill failed to include a healthy selection of cinema. Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the "flickering shadow sweethearts" would preclude their usurpation of the paramount place in the public's affection. With the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, however, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained, for many, the chief point in favour of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue. </p>
<p>Inevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances. Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade. Even the hardiest within the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal. The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but the majority of theatres were forced by the Great Depression to economize.</p>
<p>Some in the industry blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.</p>
<p>Though talk of its resurrection was heard throughout the 1930s and after, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the inescapably higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.</p>

				<h1>Constantin Stanislavski</h1>
	<img src="images/Stanislavski.jpg" alt="Stanislavski" /><br />
    
    <p>Born 17th January 1863 in Russia</p>
    <p>Russian actor and theatre director</p>
    <p>Grew up in one of the richest families in Russia, the Alekseyevs</p>
    <p>Changed name in 1884 to 'Stanislavski' so as to hide his performance activities from his parents</p>
    <p>Actors had low social status in Russia than the rest of Europe after having recently been serfs and therefore the property of the nobility</p>
    <p>Until the Russian Revolution in 1917, Stanislavski used his family wealth to fund his theatrical experiments and acting and directing</p>
    <p>As a child his interests were circus, ballet and puppetry</p>
    <p>Father was elected head of the merchant class in Moscow in 1877 and a year later had a theatre built on his estate</p>
    <p>Stanislavski began to keep a series of notebooks filled with observations of his acting and problems from which his system later emerged</p>
    <p>Stanislavski's 'system' is a systematic approach to training actors. Areas of study include concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis. Stanislavski's goal was to find a universally applicable approach that could be of service to all actors</p>
    <p>Stanislavski's 'system' focused on the development of artistic truth onstage by teaching actors to "experience the part" during performance. Stanislavski hoped that the 'system' could be applied to all forms of drama, including melodrama, vaudeville, and opera. He organised a series of theatre studios in which young actors were trained in his 'system.' At the First Studio, actors were instructed to use their own memories in order to express emotion.</p>
    <p>Stanislavski soon observed that some of the actors using or abusing this technique were given to hysteria. He began to search for more reliable means to access emotion, eventually emphasizing the actor's use of imagination and belief in the given circumstances of the text rather than her/his private and often painful memories.</p>
    <p>While in its very earliest stages his 'system' focused on creating truthful emotions and embodying them, he later worked on the Method of Physical Actions. This was developed at the Opera Dramatic Studio from the early 1930s. Its focus was on physical actions as a means to access truthful emotion, and involved improvisation. The focus remained on reaching the subconscious through the conscious.</p>
    <p>1881 the family had a second theatre built in Moscow</p>
    <p>He would disguise himself as a tramp or drunk and visit the railway station or as fortune telling gypsy; as late as 1900 he amused holiday makers in Yalta by taking a walk each morning 'in character'</p>
    <p>1884 began vocal training and exploring the co-ordination of the voice and the body</p>
    <p>1885 he studied at the Moscow Theatre School but left after two weeks, disappointed in their methods</p>
    <p>Became interested in the Maly Theatre- home of psychological theatre in Russia, which was interested in the common concern for truth of character and situation</p>
    <p>1887-8 his family's factory made substantial profits and so formed The Society of Art and Literature- united amateur and professional actors and artists</p>
    <p>Spent the summer studying the classes and performances of the Comedie-Francaise ion Paris and set up his drama school in October 1888</p>
    <p>1889 married Lilina an actress. Their first child died of pneumonia in 1890, second daughter born 1891 and their son was born in 1894</p>
    <p>His father died in 1893</p>
    <p>1889 in the play 'Men Above the Law' he discovered his 'principle of opposites' and removed prompters from society productions</p>
    <p>Production shad a rigid control of the mise-en-scene and the strict choreography of the actors gestures to reveal the inner kernel of the play</p>
    <p>1897 joined Anton Chekov to speak about creating a touring theatre company but it was with Vladimir Nemirovich- Danchenko that the Moscow Art Theatre was created</p>
    <p>They would create realistic theatre that was internationally renowned</p>
    <p>The company was introduced to his working method of extensive research, reading and detailed rehearsals</p>
    <p>1898 they produced Anton Chekov's 'The Seagull' to great acclaim and the image of a seagull is now the company's emblem</p>
    <p>Two of his former students, Richard Boleslavsky and Maria Ouspenskaya, founded the American Laboratory Theatre in 1925. One of their students, Lee Strasberg, went on to co-found the Group Theatre (1931-1940) with Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford, which was the first American acting company to put Stanislavski's initial discoveries into practice</p>
    <p>Died 7th August 1938</p>

				<h1>Antonin Artaud</h1>
	<img src="images/Artaud.gif" alt="boal" /><br />
    <p>Born 4th Sept 1896, Marseille, France
<p>Playwright, poet, actor and director</p>

<p>Treated with opium and laudanum</p>
<p>became an addiction</p>
<p>Read works by Edgar Allen Poe</p>
<p>Moved to Paris in 1920</p>
<p>Directed surrealist movement in 1925</p>

<p>Travelled to Mexico</p>
<p>lived with the Tarahumaran people.</p>
<p>experimented with peyote</p>
<p>recorded his experiences as poems.</p>

<p>Return the walking stick to Ireland.</p>
<p>On returning to ship he believed he was being attacked by 2 crew members</p>
<p>retaliated and was put in a straight jacket.</p>
<p> Died 4th March 1948 in Paris</p>
<p>Theatre of the Absurd- written in the late 1940's, 50's and 60's</p>
<p>Expressed the belief that in a godless universe:</p>
<p>human existence has no meaning or purpose</p>
<p>all communication breaks down.</p>
<p>logical argument gives way to illogical speech and ultimately, silence.</p>
<p>Well known playwrights:</p>
<p>Samuel Beckett,</p>
<p> Eugene Ionesco,</p>
<p>Tom Stoppard,</p>
<p>Harold Pinter</p>
<p>Edward Albee.</p>
<p>Coined by the critic Martin Esslin (title of book on subject in 1961.)</p>
<p> The mode of most absurdist plays is 'tragicomedy' and Shakespeare is cited as an influence of this.</p>
<p>Mostly tragedy but also includes Commedia dell'arte and Vaudeville.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, The Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton have all influenced absurdist theatre.</p>
<p>Techniques were borrowed from earlier innovators</p>
<p>Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll (Poets)</p>
<p>Bertolt Brecht (Epic Theatre)</p>
<p>August Strindberg (Dream Plays)</p>
<p>The characters are often lost in an incomprehensible universe, trapped in a small space or in a routine.</p>
<p>often in pairs known as the 'pseudocouple'.</p>
<p>may be roughly equal or one more dominant who tortures the other.</p>
<p>The plot is</p>
<p>repetitive, full of cliche and routine. Can be cyclical, ending as it began.</p>
<p>often includes a menacing force that remains a mystery.</p>
<p>may revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis of some kind, a supernatural change.</p>
<p>The language is</p>
<p>naturalistic moments where the characters resort to cliche and repetition</p>
<p>becomes nonsensical, creating misunderstanding among the characters</p>
<p>This makes the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.</p>

				<h1>Jerzy Grotowski</h1>
	<img src="images/Grotowski.jpg" alt="Grotowski" /><br />
    <p>Born in Poland on August 11th 1933</p>
<p>Theatre director</p>
<p>Innovator of experimental theatre</p>
<p>Influenced by director Peter Brook</p>
<p>Came to the West in 1968 with his production of 'Acropolis' by Stanislaw Wyspianski at the Edinburgh Festival introducing 'The Poor Theatre' concept to the western world</p>
<p>Died in Italy 14th January 1999</p>
<p>Grotowski felt that theatre had become very elaborate</p>
<p>Costumes, set, props</p>
<p>Sound, lighting and colour (in films)</p>
<p>No point competing with film - theatre should get back to its roots</p>
<p>"It if cannot be richer than the cinema, then let it be poor."</p>
<p>Poor Theatre uses</p>
<p>limited set</p>
<p>a few functional props</p>
<p>very little lighting and sound.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on the actor using the strength of their natural voice and body.</p>
<p>South African playwrights, such as Athol Fugard were fascinated by the idea.</p>
<p>There was no money for theatre so this worked perfectly for them.</p>
<p>The Laboratory Theatre began in 1959 when Gotowski was managing The Theatre of 13 Rows with Ludwig Flaszen in Opole, Poland. Later changed to Laboratory Theatre of 13 Rows.</p>
<p>This was not method acting.</p>
<p>Grotowski would run workshops called a laboratory where the focus was on the actor.</p>
<p>It focused on stripping the actor down to their essential self</p>
<p>not a collection of skills (or 'bag of tricks' as he called method acting),</p>
<p>getting rid of blocks.</p>
<p>Exercises require a great deal of concentration and commitment.</p>
<p>The actors had to find the strength of their natural voice and body.</p>
<p>The perfection of these techniques was not as important as an awareness of the process itself.</p>

<p>In 1909 the whole family was reunited on the Lower East side of Manhattan where they lived until the 1920s</p>
<p>A relative gave him a small role in a yiddish language production performed by the Progressive Drama Club</p>
<p>Aged 23 he enrolled in the Clare Tree Major School of the Theatre</p>
<p>1926 married Nora Krecaun until her death 3 years later</p>

<p>Left to study with students of Stanislavski at the American Laboratory Theatre.</p>
<p>Formed the Group Theatre in 1931 where he created a technique called 'the method' or 'method acting'</p>
<p>Started directing but soon his time was taken up with training actors and a 3 year programe was created</p>
<p>1947 the Actors Studio was created and Strasberg became artistic director in 1951</p>
<p>Actors he taught include Marilyn Monroe, Paul Newman and Al Pacino</p>
<p>The Actors Studio is now one of the most prestigious acting institutions in the world</p>
<p>Jack Nicholson auditioned 5 times before being accepted, Dustin Hoffman 6 times, Harvey Keitel 11 times</p>
<p>In one year out of 2 thousand candidates that auditioned only two were accepted- Martin Landau and Steve McQueen</p>
<p>Strasberg wrote, "The two areas of discovery that were of primary importance in my work at the Actors Studio and in my private classes were improvisation and affective memory. It is finally by using these techniques that the actor can express the appropriate emotions demanded of the character"</p>
<p>Strasberg demanded great discipline of his actors as well as great depths of psychological truthfulness.</p>
<p>In 1966, Strasberg established Actors Studio West in Los Angeles. In 1969, he founded the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York and Los Angeles. Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel lead this nonprofit studio dedicated to the development of actors, playwrights, and directors</p>
<p>In 1974, at the suggestion of his former student Al Pacino, Strasberg acted in a key supporting role alongside Pacino in 'Godfather II' and again in '...And Justice for All' (1979)</p>
<p>17th February 1982 suffered a fatal heart attack and died. The day before he had been informed that he had been elected to the American Theatre Hall of Fame</p>

If colours aren't lasting very long in scrollers, try changing the focus of the lantern. HEAT SHIELD clear gel should be used between the lens and the colour scroller to absorb some of the heat.
2) Wheel: Electrically or manually operated disc which is fitted to the front of a lantern with several apertures holding different colour filters which can be selected to enable colour changes. Can also be selected to run continuously.

		<h1>Colour filter</h1>
		<p>A sheet of plastic usually composed of a coloured resin sandwiched between two clear pieces. The coloured filter absorbs all the colours of light except the colour of the filter itself, which it allows through. For this reason, denser colours get very hot, and can burn out very quickly.
There are a number of manufacturers of Colour Filters - Lee (UK), Rosco (US), Gam (Great American Market - US) and Apollo (US) are some of the more popular. Each manufacturer's range has a numbering system for the different colours. It's important to specify which range you're talking about when quoting numbers.
A colour filter is sometimes known as a Gel, after the animal material Gelatine, from which filters were originally made.
A colour frame is used to hold the colour filter, which slots into the colour runners in front of the lens of the lantern, just behind the barn doors (for a Fresnel or PC).

		<h1>Colour mixing</h1>
		<p>Combining the effects of two or more lighting gels:
1) Additive : Focusing two differently coloured beams of light onto the same area (e.g. Cyc Floods). Combining colours in this way adds the colours together, eventually arriving at white. The three primary colours additively mix to form white, as do the complementary colours. 
2) Subtractive : Placing two different gels in front of the same lantern. Subtractive mixing is used to obtain a colour effect that is not available from stock or from manufacturers. Because the ranges of colour are so wide, the need for subtractive mixing is reducing. Combining colours in this way reduces the light towards blackness. The three primary colours mix subtractively to form black (or to block all the light).

		<h1>Colour temperature</h1>
		<p>A measure of the 'warmth' or 'coolness' of light sources and colours. Measured in degrees Kelvin. A higher colour temperature light source will appear whiter (colder). The human brain automatically compensates for different colour temperatures - a film or video camera cannot, and thus what we see as white may appear to have a blue or green tint when no colour correction is used for video. Most video cameras have a 'White Balance' control to make colour temperature adjustments, to ensure white looks white on camera.
Daylight is approximately 5600°K, Tungsten Halogen is approx. 3200°K and standard incandescent lamps are 2800°K. Many discharge light sources are in use in modern theatrical productions using discharge followspots or moving lights - colour correction filters are used to balance the colour temperatures.

		<p>System for giving technical staff and actors silent cues by light. Cue lights ensure greater precision when visibility or audibility of actors is limited. Sometimes used for cueing actors onto the set. For technical cues, lights are normally now used just as a backup to cues given over the headset system. In the UK, a flashing Red light means stand-by or warn, green light means go. The actor / technician can acknowledge the standby by pressing a button which makes the light go steady. In the US, a red light means warn, and when the light goes off, it means GO. The UK system seems to be more secure, but it depends what you're used to.</p>

		<h1>Gobo</h1>
		<p>A thin metal plate etched to produce a design which can then be projected by a profile spotlight. There are hundreds of gobo designs available - common examples are breakup (foliage), windows and scenic (neon signs, city scapes etc.). The image can be used soft focus to add texture, rather than a defined image. A number of composite gobos in different coloured lanterns can, with careful focusing, produce a coloured image (e.g. a stained glass window). Greater detail can be achieved using a glass gobo, which consists of a thin layer of aluminium etched onto glass.
There are a few possible origins for the word GOBO.
1) It came from the early days of Hollywood. When the Director of Photography wanted daylight excluded from some area of the set, he'd say 'GO Blackout'. Loads of people would run around putting black material between the sun and the set.
2) It stands for Graphical Optical Blackout.
3) It's short for Go-Between, as the gobo goes between the lamp and the lens.
4) It's short of GO Before Objective (i.e. it goes before the Objective lens).
Material from 1967 uses the word 'MASK', and no mention is made of 'GOBO', so we can assume the word wasn't in widespread use then. In the US TV/Film industry, a Gobo is a piece of material used to mask or block light, placed in front of a lantern (also known as a SHADOW MASK) and a Cookie (short for Cucaloris(from the Greek kukaloris: the breaking up of light)) is the same as a UK Gobo. PATTERN and TEMPLATE can also refer to a gobo in some areas.
In the film industry, the word gobo can be used as a verb (e.g. 'We need to gobo off that light so the camera doesn't see it').</p>

		<h1>Moving light</h1>
		<p>Remotely controllable "intelligent" lighting instrument. Each instrument is capable of a massive variety of effects which are operated live via a moving light control desk, or can be pre-programmed by a standard memory lighting desk. The instruments require a power supply and a data cable (normally carrying DMX512 signal from the control desk). 
There are broadly two types:
1) Moving Head: A luminaire is mounted on a moving yoke.
2) Moving Mirror: A stationary luminaire directs light onto a motorized mirror. 
Both types have in common:
- A discharge (non-dimmable) light source
- A dimming shutter
- Motorized rotating colour wheels. Some offer colour mixing using graduated red, green and blue wheels or prisms.
- Profile versions have motorized gobo wheels with rotation.
- Strobing effects and adjustable iris. Some also have shutters.
The term "intelligent" is used as the instrument has a processor chip and electronics built into it, not because it's able to interpret the designer's artistic intent! It can be incredibly frustrating trying to get moving lights to behave exactly as required in a dramatic situation. Musicals and live music performances are more forgiving.
Moving Head lanterns are sometimes known as NODDING BUCKETS, Moving Mirrors are sometimes known as WIGGLIES or SCANNERS.</p>

The Parcan first appeared in the early 1970's in the Rock concert industry due to the intensity of the beam, and the light weight and near indestructibility of the lantern. The lens of the lamp is either clear (which produces a narrow beam), frosted (medium) or stippled (wide).</p>

(i.e. a strobe should operate at less than 4 flashes per second, or more than 50 flashes per second). If the effect is momentary, this rule may be relaxed. Strobes must never be used in public areas where there are changes of level or steps. 
Always seek the advice of the licensing authority if you are in any doubt about the safety of strobe effects.</p>
